The machine originated in studies done in   l964-1965 for a Mars orbiter and lander called "Voyager" and   Mariner Mars 1966, neither of which flew</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">16</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The major difference between the fixed sequencers   and the programmable sequencer is that it had a memory of 128   words that could be altered in flight. Although this device had   far greater flexibility and capabilities than the fixed   sequencers, one of the older sequencers traveled on the spacecraft   as a backup. During critical maneuvers, the two sequencers would   run in parallel, a disagreement causing an abort of the maneuver.   The Sequencer commanded all spacecraft systems, including the   Attitude and Pointing System and Flight Data System, each of which   evolved to include their own computers by the time JPL designed   the outer planets Voyager in the 1970s.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">145</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Original   requirements for Mariner Mars 1969 called for 20 words of memory,   making the 128-word version more than enough. Yet the memory was   quickly exceeded, necessitating the use of "creative" programming   techniques for the duration of the mission. Fortunately, the   Sequencer was reprogrammable in flight. Memory locations used for   terminated mission phases could be given to tasks scheduled for   later. Edward Greenberg of JPL, who did most of the programming,   replaced the launch and mid-course burn routines with new code   after they had been executed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">17</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite the autonomy and flexibility   gained by using the programmable Central Computer and Sequencer,   the two Mariner Mars 1969 missions were the "most commanded" to   that date. Mariner VI received 946 radio commands, Mariner VII got   957; either number exceeded the total number of commands sent to   all the three previous successful missions   combined</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">18</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. One of the reasons for this was the memory   restrictions; another could be that the engineers on the project   downplayed the full capabilities of the Sequencer, not realizing   what was possible</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">19</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. However, the full capabilities of the device were   more than exercised on the last Mariner missions.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></P><DL>   <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Box 5-1: Programmable Central Computer and   Sequencer Architecture and Software</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">The new Central Computer and Sequencer had   no accumulator or central registers common to standard computers.   Each memory location could be used as a register, and all   operations began at a location, acted on the contents of another   location, and ended in a third memory location</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">20</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Memory consisted of 22-bit words stored in   magnetic core, with destructive serial readout</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">21</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Three types of words could be stored. An   instruction word used the first 4 bits for one of the 16 operation   codes, the next 9 for the address of the memory location to be   acted on, and the last 9 for the address of where to go   afterward</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">22</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Instruction DHJ meant "decrement hours and jump,"   so the computer would subtract one from the time portion of the   event word stored in the location specified by the first address   in the instruction and then jump to the location specified by the   second address. An event word contained a 13-bit time, scaled to   hours, minutes, or seconds, and a 9-bit address of where to go to   start the event being timed when the time part   zeroed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">23</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. For instance, if the event word was timing the   mid-course correction burn, when the time portion reached zero, a   branch would occur to the specified address, the first address of   the mid-course maneuver subroutine. The last type of word was a   data word, containing 22 bits of data.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">146</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] An instruction   set of 16 operation codes contained mostly counting-type   instructions: five scaled decrementing instructions (countdown   hours, minutes, seconds, variables), and an incrementing   instruction (count and jump). There was an ADD and a SUBtract,   each requiring 27 milliseconds of machine time, by far the slowest   instructions. Programmers used those very rarely, as the other   instructions were better suited to sequencing. Subtraction was in   one's complement form.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">The sequencer executed the software by   making a scan of the first seven instructions each   hour</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">24</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Those instructions constituted the entire   executive! They contained sufficient decrement and branching   instructions to check if anything needed to be done during that   hour of flight. As an example, the exec might contain a counter   that kept track of the time to an imaging session.
