Both Voyager spacecraft inherited   command computers from the Viking project. Computers for specific   functions such as attitude control and data formatting were added   in response to increased requirements. The result was a   functionally distributed system of processors. Galileo's project   managers also adopted the concept of functional distribution,   assigning microprocessors to control attitude and, in the   lower-level modules of the Command and Data Subsystem, to connect   to engineering and other instruments, including the scientific   experiments. Additional innovations on the Galileo spacecraft   centered on the development of virtual machine software, which   distributes functions over several processors. </FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Advancing microprocessor technology makes   the continuation of the concept of single function computers more   attractive. At JPL, plans are currently under way for the Mariner   Mark II, which will be the deep space version of the Multimission   Modular Spacecraft developed by Goddard Space Flight Center for   earth orbital operations. Using the same concepts of a standard   bus and modular equipment, JPL hopes to reduce mission costs to   $400 million each, about half the price of   Galileo</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">147</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The staff is exploring the use of the C   programming language, a very powerful tool, for the new   spacecraft. Future missions seem certain to use multicomputers,   with internal networks similar to Galileo's. In the 15 years since   the first primitive programmable sequencers flew with 128 word   memories, JPL spacecraft have grown to carry 2,500 times more   memory. Progressing from simple counting to complex coordinate   transformations in such a short time is remarkable, and the   application of computer power to each spacecraft function will   make for ever more remarkable gains.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch6-3.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part3.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
