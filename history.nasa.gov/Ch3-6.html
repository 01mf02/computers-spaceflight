However, it must   be stressed that part of the success of the software management   and the hardware development was due to the small size of both.   Few programmers were involved in initial program design and   writing. This meant that communications between programmers and   teams were relatively minimal. The fact that IBM produced just 10   computers and really needed to ensure the success of just 2 of   those helped in focusing the quality assurance effort expended on   the hardware.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">83</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] What happened   after the manned Skylab program demonstrated the need for   foresight and proper attention to storage of mission-critical   materials until any possibility of their use had gone away. The   dispersal of the verification hardware is understandable, as it is   expensive to maintain. However, some provision should have been   made for retaining mission-unique capabilities such as actual   flight hardware. The destruction of the flight tapes and source   code for the software by unknown parties was inexcusable. A single   high-density disk pack could have held all relevant   material.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Skylab marked the beginning of redundant   computer hardware on manned spacecraft. It was also the first   project that developed software with awareness of proper   engineering principles. The Shuttle continued both these concepts   but on a much larger and more complex scale.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch3-5.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch4-1.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
