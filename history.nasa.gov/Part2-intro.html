A typical manned mission lasts a week or   less; the exception was Skylab, whose computers operated for 9   months straight and again later during its reactivation mission.   Unmanned missions in earth orbit or to the outer planets can last   a decade or longer. Manned spacecraft usually carry large   auxiliary power units based on fuel cell technology, as power   requirements for life support, experiments, and computers are   high. Spacecraft in earth orbit are often dependent on solar cell   arrays, which are by nature low-power generators. Interplanetary   probes use either solar cells or small radioisotope generators.   Clearly, these circumstances cause different requirements for   computers.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Of the two types of unmanned spacecraft,   one is designed for earth orbit operations and the other flies to   the moon, planets, or deep space. Earth orbiters usually need no   navigation after achieving orbit; space probes, however, are   critically dependent on proper guidance. Earth orbiters can be   commanded nearly instantaneously from the ground during the   roughly 10% of the time they are "visible" to ground stations.   Interplanetary probes need to be autonomous, at least capable of   independent routine operation, due to speed of light delays in   communication and longer periods out of earth control. Multiple   missions and simple geography prevent interplanetary probes from   being in constant contact with the three Deep Space Network   stations. Therefore, the basis of fault handling on an   interplanetary probe is failure detection and repair, whereas   earth orbiters concentrate on "safing" the spacecraft until the   ground stations can help out. For these reasons, computers became   more sophisticated on spacecraft designed to leave the gravity   pull of the earth.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Moreover, the different computers have   distinct origins. Many near earth spacecraft used a variant of a   single machine developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center,   whereas the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California   Institute of Technology, a long time NASA contractor, has   dominated computer construction for deep space flight, designing   and building an evolving series of computers for the Agency's   interplanetary probes. These two lines of development represent   the most fruitful of NASA's forays into computer [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">136</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] research.   Computers on manned spacecraft were generally developed from other   computers (Apollo from Polaris; 4Pi from the System 360).   Computers in ground operations were adapted from commercial   machines. However, computers on unmanned spacecraft were custom   designed. In these cases, NASA was not only a contract monitor but   was actively involved in development.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The making of the first NASA Standard   Spacecraft Computer, which has controlled a number of   earth-orbiting missions, has been described   elsewhere</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2-intro.html#2-intro.a">*</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. As can be inferred by its name, NASA designed this   computer to fly on multiple, varying missions, which it has done   to good effect. For example, both the Solar Maximum Mission and   the Hubble Space telescope used the computer. Goddard Space Flight   Center led development of the device over a 10-year period from   the late 1960s to the late 1970s.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">136</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   </FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p136.jpg" ALT="Figure B"   WIDTH=541 HEIGHT=330 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight   ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Figure B: The NASA Standard   Spacecraft Computer I in its packaging.
