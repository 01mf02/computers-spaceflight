For a number of reasons, planners   rejected the direct flight method of launching from the earth,   flying straight to the moon, and landing directly on the surface.   Besides the need for an extremely large booster, it would require   flawless guidance to land in the selected spot on a moving target   a quarter of a million miles away. A spacecraft with a separate   lander would segment the guidance problem into manageable   portions. First, the entire translunar spacecraft would be placed   in earth orbit for a revolution or two to properly prepare to   enter an intercept orbit with the moon. Upon arriving near the   moon, the spacecraft would enter a lunar orbit. It was easier to   target a lunar orbit window than a point on the surface. The   lander would then detach and descend to the surface, needing only   to guide itself for a relatively short time. Alter completion of   the lunar exploration, a part of the lander would return to the   spacecraft still in orbit and transfer crew and surface samples,   after which the command module (CM) would leave for earth.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">With a lunar orbit rendezvous mission,   more than one computer would be required, since both the CM and   the lunar excursion module (LEM) needed on-board computers for the   guidance and navigation function. The CM's computer would handle   the translunar and transearth navigation and the LEM's would   provide for autonomous landing, ascent, and rendezvous   guidance.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA referred to this system with its two   computers, identical in design but with different software, as the   Primary Guidance, [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">31</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;Navigation,   and Control System (PGNCS pronounced "pings"). The LEM had an   additional computer as part of the Abort Guidance System (AGS),   according to the NASA requirement that a first failure should not   jeopardize the crew. Ground systems backed up the CM computer and   its associated guidance system so that if the CM system failed,   the spacecraft could be guided manually based on data transmitted   from the ground. If contact with the ground were lost, the CM   system had autonomous return capability. Since the lunar landing   did not allow the ground to act as an effective backup, the LEM   had the AGS to provide backup ascent and rendezvous guidance. If   the PGNCS failed during descent, the AGS would abort to lunar   orbit and assist in rendezvous with the CM. It would not be   capable of providing landing assistance except to monitor the   performance of the PGNCS. Therefore the computer systems on the   Apollo spacecraft consisted of three processors, two as part of   the PGNCS and one as part of the AGS.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch2-2.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch2-4.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
