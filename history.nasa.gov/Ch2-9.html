Also, more participation by management in the early   phases of software design is necessary so that costs can be more   effectively estimated and controlled.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">From the standpoint of development, NASA   learned that a more thorough, early effort at total systems   engineering must be made so that specifications can be adequately   set. NASA contractors in the Apollo program faced changing   specifications long after final requirements should have been   fixed. This was expensive and caused such problems as Raytheon's   retooling, memory shortages, and design insufficiencies.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The realization that software is more   difficult to develop than hardware is one of the most important   lessons of the Apollo program. So the choice of memory should be   software driven, and designers should develop software needed for   manned spaceflight near the Manned Spacecraft Center. The   arrangement with MIT reduced overall quality and efficiency due to   lack of communication. Also, more modularization of the software   was needed </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">180</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The AGC system served well on the   earth-orbital missions, the six lunar landing missions, the three   Skylab missions, and the Apollo-Soyuz test project. Even though   plans existed to expand the computer to 16K of erasable memory and   65K of fixed memory, including making direct memory addressing   possible for the erasable portion, no expansion   occurred</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">181</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The Apollo computer did fly on missions other than   Apollo. An F-8 research aircraft used a lunar module computer as   part of a "fly-by-wire" system, in which control [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">63</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;surfaces   moved by servos at the direction of electronic signals instead of   traditional cables and hydraulics. In that way, the Apollo system   made a direct research contribution to the Shuttle, which is   completely a fly-by-wire craft. The most important legacy of the   AGC, however, was in the way NASA applied the lessons it was   beginning to learn in developing ground software to the management   of flight software.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch2-8.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch3-1.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
