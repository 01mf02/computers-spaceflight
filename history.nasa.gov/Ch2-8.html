The   330-page "Apollo Spacecraft News Reference" prepared for the first   lunar landing mission does not contain a single reference to it,   compared with several pages of description of the Primary   Guidance, Navigation, and Control System (PGNCS) computer and its   interfaces. The invisibility of the AGS is a tribute to PGNCS,   since the AGS was never needed to abort a landing. It was,   however, an interesting and pioneering system in its own   right.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The AGS owed its existence to NASA's abort   policy; an abort is ordered if one additional system failure would   potentially cause loss of crew</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">160</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Hence, the failure of either the PGNCS or the AGS   would have resulted in an abort. The AGS operated in an open loop,   parallel to the PGNCS in the LEM, and gave the crew an independent   source of position, velocity, attitude, and steering   information</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">161</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. It could verify navigation data during the periods   when the LEM was behind the moon and blacked out from ground   control. The Apollo program first exercised this capability during   Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 leading up to the first landing   mission</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">162</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The AGS was a pioneer in that it was the   first "strapped-down" guidance system.

The entire system occupied only 3 cubic feet and   consisted of three major components: (a) an Abort Electronic   Assembly (AEA), which was the computer, (b) an Abort Sensor   Assembly (ASA), which was the inertial sensor, and (c) a Data   Entry and Display Assembly (DEDA), which was the DSKY for the   AGS.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">AEA and DEDA: The Computer   Hardware</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">As with the PGNCS computer, the AGS   computer went through an evolutionary period in which designers   clarified and settled the requirements. The first design for the   system did not include a true computer at all but rather a   "programmer," a fairly straightforward sequencer of about 2,000   words fixed memory, which did not have navigation functions. Its   job was simply to abort the LEM to a "clear" lunar orbit (one that   would be higher than any mountain ranges) at which point the crew   would wait for rescue from the CM, with its more sophisticated   navigation and maneuvering system</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">164</A></FONT></SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> The requirements   changed in the fall of 1964.

TRW, the contractor, then decided to include a   computer of about 4,000 words memory. The company considered an   existing Univector accumulation machine but, instead, chose a   custom designed computer</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">166</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The computer built for the AGS was the   MARCO 4418 (for Man Rated Computer). It was an 18-bit machine,   with 17 magnitude bits and a sign bit. It used 5-bit op codes and   13-bit addresses. Numbers were stored in the two's complement   form, fixed point, same as in the primary computer. Twenty-seven   instructions were available, and the execution time varied from 10   to 70 microseconds, depending on the instruction being   performed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">167</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

The memory was bit serial access, which made it   slower than the PGNCS computer, and it was divided into 2K of   fixed cores and 2K of erasable cores</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">169</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The actual cores used in the fixed and erasable   portions were of the same construction, unlike those in the PGNCS   computer.

Tindall   recalled that the changes all had to be made in the erasable   portion, as the fixed portion was programmed early and remained   set to save money.

Also, some software decisions had to be altered in   light of possible disastrous effects. The restart program for the   PGNCS has been described. In it, a restart clears all engine   burns.
