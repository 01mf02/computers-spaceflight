Yet NASA found numerous uses for   computers in areas somewhat removed from flight operations. Chief   among these are simulations and image processing, which made the   training of crews, development of launchers and spacecraft, and   analysis of image data possible.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Simulations are used in hundreds of ways   in the space program. Simulation programs and hardware test the   workings of vehicles and spacecraft, determine the accuracy of   flight paths, train controllers, check out designs, and actively   contribute to the software development process. Simulations help   NASA find out whether its programs and projects will work as   planned, lessening the risks for crews and equipment. Especially   important are simulations used in crew training and simulations   used to test hardware. Both provide models by which to judge the   extent and efficacy of NASA's dependence on simulations and to   demonstrate the dependency of such simulations on   computers.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Image processing was developed to make the   analysis of digital images transmitted by unmanned deep space   craft more consistent and fruitful. At first largely driven by the   needs of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) scientific   community, imaging spread quickly with applications such as   Landsat and the Shuttle's imaging radar. From spectacular images   of distant worlds to detailed pictures of the neighbor's farm,   imaging technology has contributed to the quality of life on   earth. Without the use of high-speed computers, the analysis and   use of the billions of bits of imaging data would be   impossible.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR>   </FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch8-3.html"><IMG   SRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40   BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part3.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"   ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2   ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch9-2.html"><IMG SRC="Next.gif"   ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2   ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></DL></BODY></HTML>
