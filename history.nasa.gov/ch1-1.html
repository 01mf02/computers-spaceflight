The McDonnell-Douglas   Corporation developed the Mercury spacecraft in the familiar bell   shape. It was barely large enough for its single occupant and had   no independent maneuvering capability save attitude control jets.   Its orbital path was completely dependent on the accuracy of the   guidance of the Atlas booster rocket. Re-entry was calculated by a   realtime computing center on the ground, with retrofire times and   firing attitude transmitted to the spacecraft while in flight.   Therefore, it was unnecessary for the Mercury spacecraft to have a   computer, as all functions required for its limited flight   objectives were handled by other systems.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Gemini both continued the objectives of   the Mercury program and served as a test bed for the development   of rendezvous techniques critical to lunar   missions</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">1</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. At first glance, the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft   are quite similar. They share the bell shape and other   characteristics, partially because Gemini was designed as an   enlarged Mercury and because the prime contractor was the same for   both craft. The obvious difference is the presence of a second   crew member and an orbital maneuvering system attached to the rear   of the main cabin. The presence of a second crewman meant that   more instrumentation could be placed in Gemini and that more   experiments could be performed, as an extra set of eyes and hands   would be available. Gemini's maneuvering capability made it   possible to practice rendezvous techniques. The main rendezvous   target was planned to be the Agena, an upper stage rocket with a   restartable liquid propellant engine that could be launched by an   Atlas booster. After rendezvous with an Agena, the Gemini would   have greatly increased maneuvering capability because it could use   the rocket on the Agena to raise its orbit.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Successful rendezvous required accurate   orbital insertion, complex catch-up maneuvering, finely tuned   movements while making the final approach to the target, and   guidance during maneuvers with the Agena. Safety during the   critical powered ascent phase demanded some backup to the ascent   guidance system on the Titan II booster vehicle. The Gemini   designers also wanted to add accuracy to re-entry and to automate   some of the preflight checkout functions. These varied   requirements dictated that the spacecraft carry some sort of   active, on-board computing capability. The resulting device was   the Gemini digital computer.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Gemini computer functioned in six   mission phases: prelaunch, ascent backup, insertion, catch-up,   rendezvous, and re-entry. These requirements demanded a very   reliable, fairly sophisticated digital computer with simple crew   interfaces. IBM built such a machine for the Gemini   spacecraft.</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">By the early 1960s, engineers were searchingfor ways to automate checkout procedures and reduce the number ofdiscrete test lines connected to launch vehicles and spacecraft.Gemini's computer.... </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><DL>   <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">11</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   </FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p11.jpg"   ALT="Figure 1-1.

Thus, it would be impossible to provide the sort of   continuous updates needed for rendezvous maneuvers. For example,   Gemini XI was planned as a first-orbit Agena rendezvous, with some   of the critical maneuvers conducted outside of telemetry   range</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">5</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

In computer-controlled descents, the roll attitude   and rate are handled by the computer to affect the point of   touchdown and re-entry heating. The Gemini spacecraft had   sufficient lift capability to adjust the landing point up to 500   miles on the line of flight and 40 miles laterally respective to   the line of flight. Five minutes before retrofire, the computer   was placed in re-entry mode and began to collect data. It   displayed velocity changes during and after the retrofire. During   the time the spacecraft traveled from an altitude of 400,000 feet   to when it reached 90,000 feet, the computer controlled actual   attitude</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">7</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1-intro.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch1-2.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
