Everything   associated with computers-processors, memories and input/output   (I/O) peripherals-was expensive. Many considered software   development an incidental part of the overall applications of   computing. Specialists wrote most of the software, usually in   arcane assembly languages.

Although its use in technical   applications was rapidly spreading, it was still considered too   inefficient for use on computers like the Gemini digital computer.   Many thought its compiler-produced machine code to be less   effective in utilizing machine resources than machine language   programs written by humans. Experts therefore developed   applications programs for Gemini using the tiny set of 16   instructions that the computer could execute</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">28</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This sort of programming was considered to be more   of an art than a science. Whereas the design and construction of   computer hardware followed conventional engineering principles,   software development was largely haphazard, undocumented, and   highly idiosyncratic. Many managers considered software developers   to be a different breed and best left alone. This concept of   software is a myth, and although it persists in some companies and   with some people today, by and large software is now considered as   an engineered product, little different from a rocket engine or   computer.</FONT></P>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Although the term "software engineering"   did not come into common use until 1968, programmers had applied   its basic tenets to both large and small software projects for at   least 15 years. Software engineering has evolved as programmers   learned which techniques worked, which did not, and what actually   occurred in the development of software products.

During this development process,   strict standards of documentation, configuration control, and   managing changes and the correction of errors must be maintained.   Also, breaking down the application into smaller, potentially   interchangeable parts, or modules, is a primary technique.   Communication between programming teams working on different but   interconnected modules must be kept clear and unambiguous. It is   in these areas that NASA has had the greatest impact on software   engineering.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Development of the Gemini software was a   learning experience for both NASA and IBM. It was, of course, the   first on-board software for a manned spacecraft and was certainly   a more sophisticated system than any that had flown on unmanned   spacecraft to that point. When the time came to write the software   for Gemini, programmers envisioned a single software load   containing all the code for the flight, [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">20</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] with new unique   programs to be developed for each mission</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">31</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> . Soon it became obvious that certain parts of the   program were relatively unchanged from mission to mission, such as   the ascent guidance backup. Designers then introduced   modularization, with some modules becoming parts of several   software loads.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another reason for modularization is the   fact that the programs developed for Gemini quickly exceeded the   memory available for them. Some were stored on the Auxiliary Tape   Memory until needed. The problem of poor estimation of total   memory requirements has plagued each manned spacecraft computer   system. In the case of Gemini, changed requirements and attempts   to squeeze the programs into the allotted space resulted in nine   different versions of the software</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">32</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The different versions were referred to by the   name "Gemini Math Flow."</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Tracing the development of the math flows   shows how identifying new functions caused initial memory   estimates to be wrong and how the project handled changes. Math   Flow One consisted of just four modules: Ascent, Catch-up,   Rendezvous, and Re-entry. Math Flow Two was proposed to add   orbital navigation and re-entry initialization, but it caused the   overall load to exceed the memory size and the Gemini program   office canceled the additions</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">33</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This version of the software flew on spacecraft II   in January 1965. By Math Flow Four, the re-entry initialization   program had been successfully added, but the load took up 12,150   of 12,288 available words. The plan had been to use this program   on spacecraft III and others, but a NASA directive of February,   1964 changed the guidance logic of the re-entry mode to a constant   bank angle rather than a proportional bank angle and constant roll   rate. Math Flow Five incorporated this change, but it filled the   memory and was scrubbed in favor of a modified Math Flow Three on   spacecraft III and IV, followed by Math Flow Six containing some   changes on spacecraft V through VII </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">34</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The final version, Math Flow Seven, was used on   spacecraft VIII through XII, all of which incorporated the   Auxiliary Tape Memory. It had six program modules with nine   operational modes. The six program modules of Math Flow Seven were   Executor, Prelaunch, Ascent, Catch-Up, Rendezvous, and   Re-Entry</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">35</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The Executor routine selected other routines   depending upon mission phases.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The specification procedure for the   software required McDonnell-Douglas to prepare the Specification   Control Document (SCD). This was forwarded to the IBM Space   Guidance Center in Owego, which developed a FORTRAN program to   validate the guidance equations. The use of simulations such as   the FORTRAN program was endemic to the Gemini software effort and   was later applied to software development for other spacecraft   computers.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Gemini used three levels of simulations,   beginning with the equation-validation system. The second was a   man-in-the-loop [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">21</FONT></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">] simulation to help define 1/0 requirements,   procedures, and displays. The third level was a refined digital   simulation to determine the performance characteristics of the   software, useful in error analysis. This third level was carried   out in the Configuration Control Test System (CCTS) laboratory,   which contained a Gemini computer and crew interfaces. This   Mission Verification Simulation (MVS) ensured that the guidance   system worked with the operational mission program. Further tests   of the software were done at McDonnell-Douglas and at the pad   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">36</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. NASA and IBM emphasized program verification   because there was no backup computer or backup software. The   verification process and the tools developed for it were later   applied to military projects in which IBM became   involved</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">37</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even if the software is perfect, errors   may occur because of transient hardware or software failures   during operation due to power fluctuations or unforeseen demands   on real-time programs.
