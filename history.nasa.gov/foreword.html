The reason will hopefully become apparent upon readingthis volume. NASA's use of computer technology has encompassed a longperiod starting in 1958. During this period, hardware and softwaredevelopments in the computer field were progressing throughsuccessive generations. A review of spaceflight applications of thesedevelopments offers a panoramic insight into almost two decades ofchange in the computer industry and into NASA's role.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's role is summarized at the conclusion ofthis volume:</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><DL>   <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">"NASA never asked for anything that could   not be done with the current technology. But in response, the   computer industry sometimes pushed itself just a little in a   number of areas. Just a little better software development   practices made onboard software safe, just a little better   networking made the Launch Processing System more efficient, just   a little better operating system made mission control easier, just   a little better chip makes image processing faster. NASA did not   push the state of the art, but nudged it enough times to make a   difference."</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">This report could not be compressed to typicalarticle size without destroying its usefulness and interest.
