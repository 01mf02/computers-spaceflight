The project manager for   this effort was Milton Trageser, and David Hoag was the technical   director</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">11</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. MIT personnel generally agree that they were   chosen because their work on Polaris proved that they could handle   time, weight, and performance restrictions and because of their   previous work in space navigation</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">12</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Despite their experience with aerospace computers,   the Apollo project turned out to be a genuine challenge for them.   As there were no fixed specifications when the contract was   signed, not until late 1962 did MIT have a good idea of Apollo's   requirements</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">14</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

The Apollo   computer system was one of NASA's first real-time, large scale   software application contracts</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">16</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Managing such a project was completely outside the   NASA experience. A short time after making the Apollo guidance   contract, NASA became involved in developing the on-board software   for Gemini (a much smaller and more controllable enterprise) and   the software for the Integrated Mission Control Center. Different   teams that started within the Space Task Group, later as part of   the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, managed these projects   with little interaction until the mid-1960s, when the two Gemini   systems approached successful completion and serious problems   remained with the Apollo software. Designers borrowed some   concepts to assist the Apollo project. In general, NASA personnel   involved with developing the Apollo software were in the same   virgin territory as were MIT designers. They were to learn   together the principles of software engineering as applied to   real-time problems.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch2-1.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch2-3.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
