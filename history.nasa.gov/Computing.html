Expensive to purchase and operate, the   giant computer needed a small army of technicians in constant   attendance to keep it running. Within a decade and a half, NASA   had one of the world's largest collections of such monster   computers, scattered in each of its centers. Moreover, to the   amazement of anyone who knew the computer field in 1958, NASA also   flew computers in orbit, to the moon, and to Mars, the latter   machines running unattended for months on end. Within another 10   years the giant groundbased mainframe would be supplanted by   clusters of medium-sized computers in spaceflight operations, and   the single on-board computer would be replaced by multiple   machines. These remarkable changes mirror developments in the   commercial arena. Where there were giant computers, small   computers now do similar tasks. Where there were no computers,   such as on aircraft or in automobiles, computers now ride along.   Where once the only solution was the large, centralized computing   center, distributed computers now share the load.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Since NASA is well known as an extensive   user of computers- mainly because spaceflight would not be   possible without them- there is a common sense that at least part   of the reason for the rapid growth and innovation in the computer   industry is that NASA has served as a main driver due to its   requirements. Actually, the situation is not so straightforward.   In most cases, because of the need for reliability and safety,   NASA deliberately sought to use proven equipment and techniques.   Thus, the agency often found itself in the position of having to   seek computer solutions that were behind the state of the art by   flight time. However, in other cases, some use of nearly leading   edge technology existed, mostly for ground systems, but   occasionally when no extensively proven equipment or techniques   were adequate in a flight situation. This was especially true on   unmanned spacecraft, because the absence of human pilots allowed   greater chances to be taken. Thus generalizations cannot be made,   other than that there was no conscious attempt on the part of NASA   in its flight programs to improve the technology of computing. Any   ways in which NASA contributed to the development of computer   techniques were side effects of specific requirements.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA uses computers on the ground and in   manned and unmanned spacecraft. These three areas have quite   different requirements, and the nature of the tasks assigned to   them resulted in varying types of computers and software. Thus,   the impact of NASA on computing differs in extent as a result of   the separate requirements for each field of computer use, which is   one reason why the three fields are considered in separate parts   of this volume.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Computers are an integral part of all   current spacecraft. Today they are used for guidance and   navigation functions such as [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">3</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] rendezvous,   re-entry, and mid-course corrections, as well as for system   management functions, data formatting, and attitude control.   However, Mercury, the first manned spacecraft, did not carry a   computer. Fifteen years of unmanned earth orbital and deep space   missions were carried out without general-purpose computers on   board. Yet now, the manned Shuttle and the unmanned Galileo   spacecraft simply could not function without computers. In fact,   both carry many computers, not just one. This transition has made   it possible for current spacecraft to be more versatile. Increased   versatility is the result of the power of software to change the   abilities of the computer in which it resides and, by extension,   the hardware that it controls. As missions change and become more   complex, using software to adjust for the changes is much cheaper   and faster than changing the hardware.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">On-board computers and ground-based   computers store data and do their calculations in the same way,   but they handle processes and input and output differently. A   typical ground computer of the early 1960s, when the first   computers flew on manned spacecraft, would process programs one at   a time, right after each other. This sort of processing, in which   the entire program must be loaded into memory and data must be   available in discrete form, is called "batch." Over time, computer   systems were changed to make them more efficient than batch   computing allowed. In a batch process, if the computer is doing a   calculation, the input and output devices are idle. If it is using   a peripheral device, the calculating circuits are not used. One   way to improve on efficiency of the batch process would be to   develop an operating system for computers that could permit one   program to use resources currently unneeded by another program.   Another method is to limit each program to a fraction of a second   running time before going on to the next program, running it for a   fraction and then going on until the original program gets picked   up again. This cyclic, timesliced method permits many users to be   connected to the computer or many jobs to run on the computer in   such a way that it appears that the machine is processing one at a   time. The computer is so fast that no one notices that his or her   job is being done in small segments. Each of these methods   presupposes that data for the program are available and processed,   and then the program stops. So even though lots more programs are   run through the system in a period of time, each is still handled   as a batch process. When the computer runs through all the   processes waiting for execution, it stands idle.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Spacecraft computers operate in a   radically different processing environment. They are in   "real-time" mode, handling essentially asynchronous inputs and   outputs and continuous processing, similar to a telephone operator   who does not know on which line the next call will come. For   example, computers used for controlling the descending Shuttle can   hardly process commands to the aerodynamic surfaces in batch mode.   The spacecraft would go out of control or at least lose   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">4</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   track of where it was if data were only utilized in small bunches.   The requirement for real-time processing leads to other   requirements for spacecraft computers not normally found on   earth-based systems. Software must not "crash" or have an abnormal   end. If the software stops, the vehicle ceases to be controllable.   Hardware must also be highly reliable, or reliability can be   obtained through redundancy If the latter course is chosen,   overhead in the form of redundancy management hardware and   software will be high. Memories must be nonvolatile in most   applications, so if power is lost then the program in storage will   not disappear. Since modern semiconductor, random-access memories   are usually volatile, older technology memories such as ferrite   core continue to be used on spacecraft. Weight, size and power are   other considerations, just as with all components on a   spacecraft.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even though both manned and unmanned   spacecraft have similar requirements, until very recently they   could not use the same computers. No computer with sufficient   calculating capability to control the Shuttle flew on an unmanned   spacecraft. Conversely, the Shuttle computers are so large and   power hungry they would overwhelm the power supply of a deep space   probe. Modern powerful microprocessors make it possible to   overcome these deficiencies, but systems described herein predate   most microprocessor technology. Also, computers on manned   spacecraft are oriented toward relatively short-term missions   lasting up to a few weeks (which will change in the Space Station   and Mars Mission eras). Computers on unmanned earth orbital   missions and deep space probes need to run reliably for years, yet   must have low power requirements. Even though both need to be   trustworthy, the different mission conditions dictate how   reliability is to be attained.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's challenge in the 1960s and 1970s   was to develop computer systems for spacecraft that could survive   the stress of a rocket launch, operate in the space environment,   and thus provide payloads with the increased power and   sophistication needed to achieve increasingly ambitious mission   objectives. NASA found itself both encouraging new technology and   adapting proven equipment. In manned spacecraft the tendency was   to use what was available. On unmanned spacecraft innovation had a   freer hand.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In contrast, NASA's ground computer   systems reflected the need for large-scale data processing similar   to many commercial applications, but in a real-time environment,   until recently not normally a requirement of business computing.   Therefore, commercially available computers could be procured for   most of the ground-based processing, with any innovation confined   to software that handled the real-time needs. Preflight checkout,   mission control, simulations, and image processing all have used   varying combinations of standard mainframe and minicomputers. So   NASA's impact on computing driven by ground support requirements   was largely in the area of operating systems [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">5</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] and other software   and not as much in hardware, whereas many of the on-board   computers had to be custom built. Some of the software innovations   needed on the ground have naturally had greater impact on the   wider world than those made for on-board computers. The techniques   of software development learned by NASA while doing both flight   and support programming have advanced the state of the art of   software engineering, which comprise the management and technical   principles that make it possible to build large, reliable software   systems.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even though the requirements and solutions   to computing problems in the manned on-board, unmanned on-board,   and ground arenas are different, several common themes bind the   three together. In nearly all cases, NASA managers failed to   adequately allow for system growth, often causing expensive   software and hardware additions to be made to meet scaled-down   objectives. More positively, recent developments are designed to   enable proven computer systems and techniques to fly or support   more than one mission, reducing the costs associated with   customized solutions. Also, there is a continuing reliance on   multiple smaller computers operating in a network as opposed to   large single computers, enabling task distribution and more   economical means of ensuring reliability. This last trend also   underscores the dependence on communications that has   characterized NASA's far-flung flight operations since the   beginning. These themes appear in varying strengths throughout the   stories of the individual projects.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Regardless of NASA's impact on computing,   its many uses of computing technology from 1958 on provide   valuable examples of the growth in power, diversity, and   effectiveness of the applications of computers. The late 1950s   marked the beginning of the computer industry as an indispensable   contributor to American science and business. NASA's insatiable   desire to make the most of what the industry could offer resulted   in many interesting and innovative applications of the   ever-improving technology of computing.</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Acknow.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="contents.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
