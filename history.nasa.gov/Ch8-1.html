At the point a missile is   committed to flight-as when the Shuttle solid rockets are fired or   a liquid-fueled booster rises an inch off the pad-responsibility   for monitoring and control of the spacecraft shifts from the   launch director and his crew to the flight director's team. Three   major tasks occupy the flight controllers: sampling the telemetry   stream to make certain everything is going well and to collect   science data, doing navigation calculations, and sending commands.   Manned and unmanned spacecraft require this support, with manned   spacecraft having the advantage of carrying observers and decision   makers to supplement what can be done from the ground. To   successfully support both types of missions, digital computers   must operate on massive amounts of data in real time. Mission   control tasks are beyond the abilities of humans alone.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Mission control centers and their   equipment are located far from the launch site. NASA's manned   mission control began in 1961 with Project Mercury at the Cape   Canaveral launch area, but its computers were at Goddard Space   Flight Center near Washington, D.C. Since 1964, early in the   Gemini program, both computers and controllers have been housed in   Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA's   unmanned near-earth missions are controlled mostly from Goddard,   with most deep space missions handled through the Jet Propulsion   Laboratory's (JPL) Spaceflight Operations Facility in Pasadena,   California.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to control centers, mission   support requires numerous tracking stations to collect and format   telemetry and radar data to help in monitoring and navigation and   to transmit commands. These widely scattered stations and the   control centers are linked together by the NASA Communications   Network (NASCOM), headquartered at Goddard. The Space Tracking and   Data Acquisition Network (STADAN), used to specialize in unmanned   spacecraft but, having combined with the Manned Spaceflight   Network (MSFN) in 1972, has become the general network. When all   the specified Tracking and Data Relay Satellites are in place,   they will take over much of the manned flight communications, yet   tracking is still a STADAN responsibility. Lunar and planetary   probes are the venue of the Deep Space Network, which operates   three main stations at Goldstone, California, Madrid, Spain, and   Canberra, Australia, each with a variety of antennas ranging up to   64 meters in diameter. The Deep Space Network helped with manned   lunar missions when the Apollo spacecraft [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">243</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] passed a   distance of 10,000 miles from earth</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch8-1.html#8-1a">*</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In contrast with on-board computers,   computer systems used in control centers and tracking stations   have primarily consisted of off-the-shelf equipment. NASA could   take this approach to procurement because, so far, adequate   processing power to achieve mission objectives has been available   in commercial systems. When mission control began in the late   1950s and early 1960s, software technology had not reached the   necessary level of sophistication. The prime contractor had to   develop completely new operating system software for the Vanguard,   Mercury, and Gemini programs, but was able to incorporate large   chunks of existing operating systems into those used for Apollo   and Shuttle, as well as some later deep space missions. This was   possible in part because experience and techniques learned from   designing the original operating systems were used in new   commercial products.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR>   <A NAME="8-1a"></A></FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">*</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> For the story   of the tracking and communication networks, see William R.   Corliss, Histories of the Space Tracking and Data Acquisition   Network (STADAN), the Manned Space Flight Network (MSFN). and the   NASA Communications Network (NASCOM), NASA CR-140390, June, 1974,   and N.A.
