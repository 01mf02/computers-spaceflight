JPL was responsible for the Ranger and Surveyor series   of lunar exploration spacecraft, the Mariner and Viking Orbiter   explorers of Mercury, Venus, and Mars, and the Voyager and Galileo   probes of the outer planets. As a result, the evolution of   on-board computers for deep space operations took place at   JPL.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">JPL's chief contribution to computing on   unmanned spacecraft was in leading progress from hard-wired   sequencers to programmable sequencers to digital computers. The   Pioneer spacecraft developed mostly at NASA's Ames Research Center   and the Lunar Orbiters used to map the moon in the 1960s did not   carry on-board computers. Like their earth-orbiting cousins and   the first JPL probes, they used sequencing devices to activate and   command experiments. Later the Mariner spacecraft acquired more   autonomy and flexibility by using machines that stored command   sequences in changeable software. Finally, sophisticated   spacecraft flew with special-purpose digital computers.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Unique in its relationship to NASA, JPL is   not solely a government installation in the same way as, for   example, the Johnson or Marshall Space flight Centers. JPL's   personnel receive their pay-checks from Cal Tech, yet almost every   piece of equipment on the site has a NASA property tag, since, for   over a quarter of a century, Cal Tech has administered contracts   that have paid for all research and development of the many   spacecraft originated at JPL.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another way in which JPL is unique is its   products. Whereas thousands of earth-orbiting satellites have been   launched, less than a dozen each of Rangers, Surveyors, and   Mariners were constructed, and just two Vikings and Voyagers and   one Galileo were sent into space. Not only were few spacecraft   built, but the interplanetary launches were separated by years and   had to be on strict deadlines due to the realities of celestial   mechanics. This created a completely different development   environment than that at other NASA centers. The emphasis on basic   research at JPL has perhaps been stronger than at any other NASA   installation. This orientation and its application in spacecraft   forms a special part of the story of JPL.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">JPL's computer development activities were   shaped by its organizational structures. When a project is started   at the Laboratory, an office is established to house the project   manager, key systems managers, and staff. Offices have come and   gone with the projects themselves. The Ranger office, for example,   has been closed for nearly 20 years, whereas the Voyager office is   likely to be open for as long as that. Most personnel are housed   in divisions and sections relating to specific discipline or   system functions, as, in 1984, the "Technical Divisions" contained   sections on "Guidance and Control" and "Spacecraft Data Systems."   When a project office needs a component or service, it   "subcontracts" it to the appropriate technical [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">141</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] sections. For   instance, Spacecraft Data Systems supplies on-board computers,   whereas the Navigation Systems Section does the trajectory   calculations needed for a specific mission. In this way,   specialists can be kept busy on a series of projects over a period   of years without depending on a specific project for their jobs.   Competition between sections to develop related components can   also exist, as on the Voyager project, when the attitude control   staff wanted to make their own computer for their system while the   data systems people claimed sole domain over computer development.   Within this setting, JPL has produced high quality on-board   computers that have demonstrated outstanding reliability.   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva">*</FONT></SUP></B>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">*</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> JPL'sroots and its role in NASA receive excellent treatment in ClaytonKoppes' The Jet Propulsion Lab and the American Space Program, YaleUniversity Press, 1982.<HR></FONT></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2-intro.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><B><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch5-2.html"><IMG SRC="Next.gif"ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></B></CENTER></P><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
