In the late 1960s and   early 1970s, the company internally pushed the development and   implementation of software engineering techniques. IBM learned   many lessons from the creation of the OS/360 operating system, and   various government-related projects. Two IBM software management   experts, Harlan Mills and Frederick Brooks, circulated these   lessons both within IBM and to the computing   public</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">28</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The small size (16K) of the Skylab software and   correspondingly small group of programmers assigned to write it   (never more than 75 people, not all of whom were programmers, and   only 5 or 6 for the reactivation software), meant that the   difficulties in communication and configuration control associated   with large projects were not as much of a factor. Also the IBM   programmers were specialists. MIT assigned engineers to the   programming of the Apollo computer, assuming that it was easier to   teach an engineer to program than to teach a programmer the   nuances of the system. This turned out to be a mistake, which MIT   acknowledged</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">29</A></FONT></SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Thus, the stage was   set for IBM to produce a superb real-time program.

The company   carefully separated the production process into strictly designed   phases. Two different flight loads resulted: one full-function   program that filled the 16K memory, and an 8K version as a backup   that needed only one module for storage. These two programs needed   slightly different architectures, or schemes for organizing the   execution of functions, which made the job tougher.

Applications consisted of three major groups:   time-dependent functions, asynchronous functions, and utilities.   Time-dependent functions were executed in three cycles, with the   possibility of higher priority jobs interrupting the currently   running module. The cycles were differentiated by time: There was   a "slow loop" each second, an "intermediate loop" executing five   times each second, and the switch-over processor running each half   second</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">42</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Designers grouped appropriate modules in a cycle.   An exception to the cycle groupings, but nevertheless time   dependent, was the output-write routine, which was run between   intermediate loops in order to take more efficient advantage of   the system resources. The switch-over process aided in redundancy   management, as explained below. Asynchronous functions could be   called at any time, one of which was telemetry, which sent 24   strings of 50 bits per second. The other was the command system,   which could receive signals from either the ground or the Digital   Address System (DAS, the crew interface) in the workshop. Those   signals resulted in interrupts. Utility functions included such   common algorithms as square root, sine, and cosine, and unique   functions such as gimbal angle computations and quaternion   multiplication</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">43</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Interrupt handling was quite   straightforward.

Any current task could be interrupted   when a new task was requested. The priority of the new task was   immediately entered into the priority level control tables. If the   new task was of a higher priority than the current task, the   computer did the new one first.

So   that the secondary computer would be properly activated, a 64-bit   transfer register was kept loaded with relevant data. This   register, like the timers, consisted of TMR circuits. Great care   was taken to ensure that data loaded into the transfer register   were uncontaminated. A write operation to the register was   restricted in length to a period of 672 microseconds plus or minus   20%, which was just about how long it took to write 64 bits into a   redundant circuit.
