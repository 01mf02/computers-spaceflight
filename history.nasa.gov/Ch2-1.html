Navigating from the earth to the moon and the   need for a certain amount of spacecraft autonomy dictated the use   of a computer to assist in solving the navigation, guidance, and   flight control problems inherent in such missions. Before   President John F. Kennedy publicly committed the United States to   a "national goal" of landing a man on the moon, it was necessary   to determine the feasibility of guiding a spacecraft to a landing   from a quarter of a million miles away. The availability of a   capable computer was a key factor in making that   determination.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Instrumentation Laboratory of the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had been working on   small computers for aerospace use since the late 1950s. Dr.   Raymond Alonso designed such a device in   1958-1959</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">1</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Soon after, Eldon Hall designed a computer for an   unmanned mission to photograph Mars and return</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">2</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. That computer could be interfaced with both   inertial and optical sensors. In addition, MIT was gaining   practical experience as the prime contractor for the guidance   system of the Polaris missile. In early 1961, Robert G. Chilton at   NASA-Langley Space Center and Milton Trageser at MIT set the basic   configuration for the Apollo guidance system</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">3</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. An on-board digital computer was part of the   design. The existence of these preliminary studies and the   confidence of C. Stark Draper, then director of the   Instrumentation Lab that now bears his name, contributed to NASA's   belief that the lunar landing program was possible from the   guidance standpoint.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The presence of a computer in the Apollo   spacecraft was justified for several reasons. Three were given   early in the program: (a) to avoid hostile jamming, (b) to prepare   for later long-duration (planetary) manned missions, and (c) to   prevent saturation of ground stations in the event of multiple   missions in space simultaneously</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">4</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Yet none of these became a primary justification.   Rather, it was the reality of physics expressed in the 1.5-second   time delay in a signal path from the earth to the moon and back   that provided the motivation for a computer in the lunar landing   vehicle. With the dangerous landing conditions that were expected,   which would require quick decision making and feedback, NASA   wanted less reliance on ground-based computing</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">5</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The choice, later in the program, of the lunar   orbit rendezvous method over direct flight to the moon, further   justified an on-board computer since the lunar orbit insertion   would take place on the far side of the moon, out of contact with   the earth</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">6</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. These considerations and the consensus among MIT   people that autonomy was desirable ensured the place of a computer   in the Apollo vehicle.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite the apparent desire for autonomy   expressed early in the [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">29</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] program, as the   mission profile was refined and the realities of building the   actual spacecraft and planning for its use became more immediate,   the role of the computer changed. The ground computers became the   prime determiners of the vehicle's position in three-dimensional   space "at all times" (except during maneuvers) in the   missions</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">7</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Planners even decided to calculate the lunar orbit   insertion burn on the ground and then transmit the solution to the   spacecraft computer, which somewhat negated one of the reasons for   having it. Ultimately, the actual Apollo spacecraft was only   autonomous in the sense it could return safely to earth without   help from the ground</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">8</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even with its autonomous role reduced, the   Apollo on-board computer system was integrated so fully into the   spacecraft that designers called it "the fourth crew   member"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">9</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Not only did it have navigation functions, but   also system management functions governing the guidance and   navigation components. It served as the primary source of timing   signals for 20 spacecraft systems</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">10</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The Apollo computer system did not have as long a   list of responsibilities as later spacecraft computers, but it   still handled a large number of tasks and was the object of   constant attention from the crew.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch1-5.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch2-2.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
