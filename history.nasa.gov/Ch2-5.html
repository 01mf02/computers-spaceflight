A single DSKY   was in the lunar module. The DSKYs were 8 by 8 by 7 inches and   weighed 17.5 pounds.

Many scientific computers of the time used 24-bit or   longer word lengths and, in general, the longer the word the   better the precision of the calculations.

Therefore,   the memory divided into "banks" of core, and the addressing could   be handled by first indicating which bank and then the address   within the bank. For example, taking the metaphor "address"   literally, there are probably hundreds of "100 Main Street"   addresses in any state, but by putting the appropriate city on an   envelope, a letter can be delivered to the intended 100 Main   Street without difficulty.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The computer banks were like the cities of   the analogy.

Part of the   software difficulties stemmed from functions and features that had   to be dropped because of program size considerations, and part   because of the already described addressing difficulties. If the   original designers had known that so much memory would be needed,   they might not have chosen the short word size, as a 24-bit word   could easily directly address a 36K bank, with enough room for a   healthy list of instruction codes.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">One reason the designers underestimated   the memory requirements was that NASA did not provide them with   detailed specifications as to the function of the computer. NASA   had established a need for the machine and had determined its   general tasks, and MIT received a contract based on only a short,   very general requirements statement in the request for band. The   requirements started changing immediately and continued to change   throughout the program.
