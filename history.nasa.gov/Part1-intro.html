The latter   four programs produced spacecraft that had on-board digital   computers. The Gemini computer was a single unit dedicated to   guidance and navigation functions. Apollo used computers in the   command module and lunar excursion module, again primarily for   guidance and navigation. Skylab had a dual computer system for   attitude control of the laboratory and pointing of the solar   telescope. NASA's Space Shuttle is the most computerized   spacecraft built to date, with five general-purpose computers as   the heart of the avionics system and twin computers on each of the   main engines. The Shuttle computers dominate all checkout,   guidance, navigation, systems management, payload, and powered   flight functions.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA's manned spacecraft computers are   characterized by increasing power and complexity. Without them,   the rendezvous techniques developed in the Gemini program, the   complex mission profiles followed in Apollo, the survival of the   damaged Skylab, and the reliability of the Shuttle avionics system   would not have been possible.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">When NASA began to develop systems for   manned spacecraft, general-purpose computers small and powerful   enough to meet the requirements did not exist. Their development   involved both commercial and academic organizations in repackaging   computer technology for spaceflight.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="ch1-1.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
