Multiple   missions might be in space at the same time, and large crews, many   with nonpilot passengers, were to travel in space in craft much   more self-sufficient than ever before. These circumstances, the   desire for swift turnaround time between launches, and the need to   sustain mission success through several levels of component   failure meant that the Shuttle had to incorporate a large measure   of fault tolerance in its design. As a result, NASA could do what   would have been unthinkable 20 years earlier: put men on the   Shuttle's first test flight. The key factor in enabling NASA to   take such a risk was the redundancy built into the   orbiter</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">60</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Fault tolerance on the Shuttle is achieved   through a combination of redundancy and backup.

Four of the computers, each loaded with identical   software, operate in what is termed the "redundant set" during   critical mission phases such as ascent and descent. The fifth,   since it only contains software to accomplish a "no frills" ascent   and descent, is a backup.

The first computer used in the F-8 "Crusader"   aircraft chosen for the program was a surplus AGC in simplex, with   an electronic analog backup. Later, the project engineers wanted a   duplex system using a more advanced computer. Johnson Space Center   avionics people noted the similarities between the digital   fly-by-wire program and the Shuttle. Dr. Kenneth Cox of JSC   suggested that Dryden go with a triplex system to move beyond   simple one-for-one redundancy. By coordinating procurement, NASA   outfitted both the F-8 aircraft and the Shuttle with AP-101   processors. Draper Laboratory produced software for the F-8, and   its flight tests proved the feasibility of computers operating in   synchronization, as it suffered several single point computer   failures but successfully flew on without loss of control. This   flight program did much to convince NASA of the viability of the   synchronization and redundancy management schemes developed for   the Shuttle.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">How Many Computers?</FONT></B>   </CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">One key question in redundancy planning is   how many computers are required to achieve the level of safety   desired. Using the concept of fail operational/fail   operational/fail-safe, five computers are needed. If one fails,   normal operations are still maintained. Two failures result in a   fail-safe situation, since the three remaining prevent the feared   standoff possible in dual computer systems (one is wrong, but   which?). Due to cost considerations of both equipment and time,   NASA decided to lower the requirement to fail   operational/fail-safe, which allowed the number of computers to be   reduced to four. Since five were already procured and designed   into the system, the fifth computer evolved into a backup system,   providing reduced but adequate functions for both ascent and   descent in a single memory load. NASA's decision to use four   computers has a basis in reliability projections done for   fly-by-wire aircraft.

In fact, as the first Shuttle flights approached,   Arnold Aldrich, Director of the Shuttle Office at Johnson Space   Center, circulated a memo arguing for a sixth computer to be   carried along as a spare</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">67</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">! He pointed out that since 90% of avionics   component failures were expected to be computer failures and that   since a minimum of three computers and the backup should exist for   a nominal re-entry, aborts would then have to take place after one   failure. By carrying a spare computer preloaded with the entry   software, the primary system could be brought back to full   strength. The sixth computer was indeed carried on the first few   flights. In contrast with this "suspenders and belt" approach,   John R. Garman of the Johnson Space Center Spacecraft Software   Division said that "we probably did more damage to the system as a   whole by putting in the backup"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">68</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. He felt that the institution of the backup took   much of the pressure off the developers of the primary system. No   longer was their software solely responsible for survival of the   crew. Also, integrating the priority-interrupt-driven operating   system of the primary computers with the time-slice system of the   backup caused compromises to be made in the primary.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Synchronization</FONT></B>   </CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Computer synchronization proved to be the   most difficult task in producing the Shuttle's avionics.   Synchronizing redundant computers and comparing their current   states is the best way to decide if a failure has occurred. There   are two types of synchronization used by the Shuttle's computers   in determining which of them has failed: one for the redundant set   of computers established for ascent to orbit and descent from   orbit, and one for synchronizing a common set while in orbit. It   took several years in the early 1970s to discover a way to   accomplish these two synchronizations.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The essence of Shuttle redundancy is that   each computer in the redundant set could do all the functions   necessary at a particular mission phase. For true redundancy to   take place, all computers must listen to all traffic on all buses,   even though they might be commanding just a few. That way they   know about all the data generated in the current phase. They must   also be processing that data at the same time the other computers   do. If there is a failure, then the failed computer could drop out   of the set without any functional degradation whatever. At the   start, the Shuttle's designers thought it would be possible to run   the redundant computers separately and then just compare answers   periodically to make sure that the data and calculations   matched</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">69</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. As it turned out, small differences in the   oscillators that acted as clocks within the computers caused the   computers to get out of step fairly [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">105</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] quickly.

The decision to   put in the synchronization points "settled everyone's mind" on the   issue</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">72</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Intercomputer communication is what makes   the Shuttle's avionics system uniquely advanced over other forms   of parallel computing.

An increasing need for redundancy and fault   tolerance in non-avionics systems such as banks, using automatic   tellers and nationwide computer networks, proves the usefulness of   this system. But this type of synchronization is so little known   or understood by people outside the Shuttle program that carryover   applications will be delayed.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">One reason why the redundancy management   software was able to be kept to a minimum is that NASA decided to   move voting to the actuators, rather than to do it before commands   are sent on buses. Each actuator is quadruple redundant. If a   single computer fails, it continues to send commands to an   actuator until the crew takes it out of the redundant set. Since   the Shuttle's other three computers are sending apparently correct   commands to their actuators, the failed computer's commands are   physically out-voted</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">79</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Theoretically, the only serious possibility is   that three computers would fail simultaneously, thus negating the   effects of the voting. If that occurs, and if the proper warnings   are given, the crew can then engage the backup system simply by   pressing a button located on each of the forward rotational hand   controllers.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Does the redundant set synchronization   work? As described, the F-8 version, with redundancy management   identical to the Shuttle, survived several in-flight computer   failures without mishap. On the first Shuttle Approach and Landing   Test flight, a computer failed just as the Enterprise was released   from the Boeing 747 carrier; yet the landing was still successful.   That incident did a lot to convince the astronaut pilots of the   viability of the concept.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Synchronization and redundancy together   were the methods chosen to ensure the reliability of the Shuttle   avionics hardware.

The discretes are coded for certain messages. For example,   010 means an I/O is complete without error, but 011 means that an   I/O is complete with error</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">73</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This allows more information other than just "here   I am" to be sent. If another computer either sends the wrong   synchronization code, or is late the computer detecting either of   these conditions concludes that the delinquent computer has   failed, and refuses from then on to listen to it or acknowledge   its presence. Under normal circumstances, all three good computers   should have detected the single computer's error. The bad computer   is announced to the crew with warning lights, audio signals, and   CRT messages. The crew must purposely kill the power to the failed   computer, as there is no provision for automatic powerdown. This   prevents a generic software failure causing all the computers to   be automatically shut off.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">This form of synchronization creates a   tightly coupled group of computers constantly certifying that they   are at the same place in the software. To certify that they are   achieving the same solutions, a "sumword" is used. While computers   are in a redundant set, a sumword is exchanged 6.25 times every   second on the ICC buses</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">74</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. A sumword typically consists of a 64 bits of data,   usually the least significant bits of the last outputs to the   solid rocket boosters, orbital maneuvering engines, main engines,   body flap, speed brake, rudder, elevons, throttle, the system   discretes, and the reaction control system</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">75</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Two might be left in the redundant   set to handle guidance and navigation functions, such as   maintaining the state vector. A third would run the systems   management software that controls life support, power, and the   payload. The fourth would be loaded with the descent software and   powered down, or "freeze dried," to be instantly ready to descend   in an emergency and to protect against a failure of the two MMUs.   The fifth contains the backup flight system.
