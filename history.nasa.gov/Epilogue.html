Developing and evolving over the last   quarter century, they promise to dominate NASA's use of computers   for space flight well into the future. The themes are: the need   for real time systems, the use of redundancy to maintain   reliability and safety, the choice of off-the-shelf equipment   wherever possible, the adoption of distributed processing, and   adherence to the principles of software engineering in system   development.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Real-Time Systems</FONT></B>   </CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA had no choice but to become a leader   in the development of real-time systems, beginning with the   decision to use computers to support manned and unmanned flights.   Including a computer on-board spacecraft further sealed NASA's   fate as a developer and user of embedded computer   systems-computers within larger systems replacing or enhancing   existing hardware. Therefore, it is in this field of computing   that NASA has had its greatest impact.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Contractors working on NASA's real-time   systems have been able to benefit from what they learned in the   process of completing their contract obligations. For example, an   immediate application of techniques used in the Mercury Monitor   was IBM's System 360 operating system. Later, experience with   fly-by-wire systems quickly spread to civilian and military   applications. Within 10 years of the first digital fly-by-wire   aircraft flight, airliners using the technology were in prototype.   As computers continue to shrink in size and increase in power, the   applications of real-time computing will grow enormously.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Reliability and Safety Through   Redundancy</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA has achieved increasing levels of   reliability through a concurrent increase in the levels of   redundancy. Ground systems always had an active backup. On-board   systems acquired them as size and performance improvements made it   possible. The use of computers running in parallel, working on the   same calculations, made necessary the development of redundancy   management techniques. Thus, again, NASA pioneered an area which   was as yet poorly developed.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Proven Equipment</FONT></B>   </CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">300</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Even though NASA   led the way in the development and use of some aspects of modern   computing, one area in which innovation was purposely avoided was   hardware. Acting in the belief that existing equipment is   inherently more reliable and less risky than new, custom-designed   computers, NASA sought to acquire proven processors wherever   possible. As a result, flight systems are often years behind the   current state-of-the-art. Nevertheless, they can complete the   missions for which they were purchased. In long-term programs,   such as the Shuttle, processors are being replaced by newer (but   not the newest) equipment where possible.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Distributed   Processing</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Partly as a result of safety   considerations, partly for convenience, and partly because   different organizations often contribute subsystems to the same   spacecraft, there is a continuing trend toward the use of   distributed computing both in flight and on the ground. Most new   NASA computer systems are functionally distributed. On an unmanned   spacecraft, for instance, separate computers handle command   interpretation, data acquisition and attitude control. Other   examples include the Shuttle Launch Processing System and the   Shuttle itself, which has computers on the main engines as well as   other components. Again, improved processors will make it cheaper   and easier to continue this trend in the future.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Software Engineering</FONT></B>   </CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Software engineering has always been a big   part of NASA's business, even in the era before 1968 when the term   did not yet exist. In recent years, it has become a central focus   of activity. NASA has developed an Agency-wide software   development standard and made it available to the various Centers.   Short courses on software engineering topics are being taught   routinely. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory has established a   software resource center. Goddard Space Flight Center regularly   sponsors a software engineering conference. Conferences have been   held to get an early start on the use of the the Ada programming   language in the Space Station project. Obviously, NASA is   committed to improvement and high quality in this field, as more   and more functions on space flights are taken over by   computers.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">301</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] In all, NASA has   very effectively adapted its operations to the Computer Age.   Computers, frankly, make useful spaceflight possible. Even though   a spacecraft could theoretically be placed in orbit using a World   War II tilt-table missile guidance system and mechanical clocks,   landing safely on the moon, flying within kilometers of the outer   planets, and landing on runways after descending from space would   all be unlikely happenings with the old technology. As Man begins   the era of permanent presence in space, his partner will be   millions of bits flashing in a sea of transistors, a helpmate in   the discovery of the universe.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch9-3.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="contents.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Sources.html"><IMG SRC="Next.gif"ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><DL>   <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></DL><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
