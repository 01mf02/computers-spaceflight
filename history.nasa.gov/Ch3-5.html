The original Skylab mission lasted 272 days with long   unmanned periods. The reactivation mission, flown entirely under   computer control, lasted 393 days. Therefore, the bulk of the   activated life of the space laboratory fully depended on the   ATMDCs.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">When it was obvious that the Workshop was   going to fall to the earth long before a rescue mission could be   launched, NASA began studying methods of prolonging the orbital   life of the spacecraft. Even though the atmosphere is very thin at   the altitude Skylab was flying, the drag produced on the   spacecraft was highly related to its attitude with respect to its   direction of flight (velocity vector). During most of the manned   mission periods Skylab flew in solar inertial (SI) mode, in which   the lab was kept perpendicular to the sun to provide maximum   exposure for the solar collectors. Momentum desaturation maneuvers   were done on the dark side of the earth to compensate for bias   momentum buildup resulting from noncyclic torques acting on the   spacecraft. The SI mode was high drag, so engineers devised two   new modes, end-on-velocity-vector (EOVV) and torque equilibrium   attitude (TEA). EOVV pointed the narrow end of the lab in the   direction of flight, minimizing the aerodynamic drag on the   vehicle. TEA could control the re-entry, using the gravity   gradient and gyroscopic torques to counterbalance the aerodynamic   torque. Only in this way could the Workshop be controlled below   140 nautical miles altitude</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">66</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Use of the new modes required that they be   coded and transmitted to the computers in orbit. First it was   necessary to discover whether or not the computers still   functioned. Since the ATMDC used destructive readout core   memories, there was some concern that the software might have been   destroyed during restart tests if the refreshment hardware had   failed. On March 6, 1978, NASA engineers at the Bermuda tracking   station ordered portions of Skylab to activate. On March 11, the   ATMDC powered up for 5 minutes to obtain telemetry confirmation   that it was still functioning. The software resumed the program   cycle where it had left off 4 years and 30 days earlier. As far as   the computer was concerned, it had suffered a temporary power   transient</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">67</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">!</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">When IBM began to make preparations to   modify the software, it discovered that there was almost nothing   with which to work. The [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">82</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] carefully   constructed tools used in the original software effort were   dispersed beyond recall, and, worse yet, the last of the source   code for the flight programs had been deleted just weeks   beforehand. This meant that changes to the software would have to   be hand coded in hexadecimal, as the assembler could not be used-a   risky venture in terms of ensuring accuracy. Eventually it became   necessary to repunch the 2,516 cards of a listing of the most   recent flight program, and IBM hired a subcontractor for the   purpose</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">68</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Engineers could not test this software   with the same high fidelity as during the original development.   They abandoned plans for real time simulations because they could   not find enough parts of any of the original simulators.   Interpretive simulation could be performed because the tapes for   that form of testing had been saved.

The baseline   software for the reactivation was Flight Program 80, including   change request 3091, which was already in the second computer.   Software changes for reactivation were simply handled as routine   change requests. They placed the EOVV software in memory   previously occupied by experiment calibration and other functions   useless in the new mission.
