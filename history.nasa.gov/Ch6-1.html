In spectacular encounters with Jupiter and   Saturn, Voyagers 1 and 2 returned science data and imaging that   far exceeded results of previous planetary flybys. Uranus was the   successful 1986 objective of Voyager 2, nearly 10 years after   launch. Galileo is designed for a Jupiter orbiter and probe   mission.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch6-1.html#6-1a">*</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> Both types of spacecraft carry multiple computer   systems, distributing functions among several machines, rather   than using one central computer system as on the Viking Orbiter   and Lander.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Distributed computing on large unmanned   spacecraft developed conceptually from several sources. In 1967,   Marshall Space Flight Center commissioned a study by General   Electric Corporation's Missile and Space Division in Philadelphia   as part of preparation for a huge "Voyager" Mars lander to be   launched on a Saturn V booster in the early 1970s. Marshall asked   GE to compare the advantages of a central computer configuration   versus separate computers for different subsystems. General   Electric used a highly mathematical approach to develop power,   size, and weight comparisons of the different proposals in light   of reliability considerations. Computer physical limits were set   as high as 100 pounds and 300 watts due to the large size of the   booster. This would allow computers such as the IBM 4Pi series,   Autonetics D26J, and IBM's Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer   (LVDC) to be considered. Planners expected that the functions that   later showed up on advanced Mariners-such as accelerometers,   programmable sequencers with 512 words of memory, and telemetry   registers-would be part of the proposed computer's capabilities   and responsibilities. However, GE found that economies gained by a   central system were outweighed by reliability advantages intrinsic   to a distributed system</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">1</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another approach came from Edward   Greenberg, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) engineer who   programmed for the Mariner VI and VII Central Computer and   Sequencer and contributed to the Viking Command Computer Subsystem   (CCS) design. In December, 1972, he proposed that the Viking   computer be standardized as a multimission   processor</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">2</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. His intent was to reuse hardware and software   development tools such as assemblers and simulators. Since one   Viking computer could never handle all the functions needed on   Voyager, several computers, each with a limited domain of   functions, were needed.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aside from the GE study and Greenberg's   proposal, JPL [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">173</FONT></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;developed an additional argument for   distributed computing. Edward H. Kopf, Jr., a JPL engineer   specializing in attitude control, pointed out that different   sections of the Laboratory needed computers to perform their   assignments on Voyager and Galileo. Each group wanted its "own"   computer, so that it would not be constantly competing for   resources with other groups</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">3</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Therefore, a distributed system would help keep   the peace.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The attractions of distributing computing,   reliability, potential reusability, and separation of tasks,   proved true in the development of the Voyager and Galileo   spacecraft. Each has a functionally distributed set of computers.   Voyager makes use of two of the Viking machines and a third,   custom-built, computer. Each concentrates on processing different   functions, such as attitude control, data formatting, and   commanding. Galileo has dual processors for attitude control and   six in a network for command and data handling. Both spacecraft   were designed for long-duration, autonomous flight, a goal   difficult to attain without the use of distribution.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   <IMG SRC="p173.jpg" ALT="Figure 6-1.
