Since the Chinese first started   shooting off fireworks a millennium ago, the sight of a rocket   streaking ever faster skyward, a comet's tail of fire behind, has   excited even those unimpressed with machines. Fireworks rockets,   and, later, military bombardment rockets through the first three   decades of this century, shared the same components: casing, fuel,   and payload. Construction was complete when the gunpowder fuel was   loaded in the casing, warhead affixed, and a fuse planted the   base. Such rockets could be stored without maintenance and fired   with little preparation, needing only to assure that the fuse was   still attached. The difficulty came in the area of guidance. A set   of fins or a balancing stick passively guided the early rockets.   Frequently they would turn on the men who launched them or shoot   horizontally over the heads of fireworks watchers. Thus, the old   technology of preparing rockets for flight consisted of keeping   them dry, aiming them carefully, and lighting the fuse.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In Germany during the late 1930s the new   technology of rockets began to mature. Increased interest in   rocketry developed in Europe and the United States after World War   I. Rocket societies flourished in England, Germany, and the United   States. Robert Goddard flew a liquid propellant rocket, the first   of its kind, in Massachusetts in 1926. Liquid fuels, with their   higher specific impulse and thrust potential, soon replaced solid   fuels as the primary area of propulsion research. Shortly after   Hitler came to power, the German army established a rocket   development program that led to the liquid-propellant A-4   (popularly known as the V-2). A-4 rockets far exceeded the   capabilities of previous ones, terrorizing the populations of   London and Antwerp in the latter stages of World War II. Over 14   meters tall and weighing over 12,000 kilograms, an A-4 carried   nearly 1,000 kilograms of explosive payload up to 400 kilometers.   Its guidance system was a radio beam-rider type with an electronic   analog computer controlling vanes in the exhaust and elevons on   the fins. If wind deflection caused the rocket to veer   horizontally off course, the analog computer would calculate   corrections and activate the vanes. Complex plumbing and   turbopumps were needed to feed the engine with fuel. Experience   gained in nearly 2,000 expensive failures led German technicians   working on the A-4 to develop techniques of testing the many   components of the rocket during manufacture and before committing   it to flight. For example, the guidance system was tested at the   factory by an electronic analog computer that simulated the flight   of the rocket so that the system's reactions could be   observed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">1</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. On the launching pad, engineers could test various   moving parts of the vehicle by activating them using actual   physical connections to the firing room.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">German rocket scientists who came to the   United States after World War II brought this new technology with   them. Eventually based in Huntsville, Alabama, at the Army's   Redstone Arsenal, they [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">209</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] conceived an   increasingly sophisticated series of rockets: Redstone, Jupiter,   Juno, and Saturn. Concurrently, the Air Force chartered the Atlas,   Titan, and Thor ballistic missiles. During the 1950s, each of   these vehicles was developed in programs marred by frequent flight   failures. Actual numbers and the complexity of components grew by   several factors over the A-4. The new devices and their failures   led to more testing, both at the factory and before launch. The   concept of a "countdown," during which each flight-critical   component of the vehicle is systematically checked, reached a high   level of efficiency.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">As the 1960s began, most rockets and their   payloads were still being checked out by discrete connections   between the components and a test panel. When the countdown   reached an advanced stage, particularly after fueling, the test   engineers were cloistered in a block-house. Through cables from   the rocket to the blockhouse, the engineers could monitor the   status of various components and activate tests. An engineer would   flip a switch, and something would happen, either on a dial or a   strip chart, that he could actually see and interpret. When the   first Saturn I rockets were launched and the Mercury spacecraft   made their appearance, both in 1961, it became obvious that the   level of complexity of both vehicles and payloads had reached the   point where manual test methods were inadequate. Individual NASA   engineers and managers on different programs began to evaluate the   possibility of automating some of the checkout procedures using   digital computers. Eventually, this led to the Shuttle's fully   automated Launch Processing System.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The heart of the Shuttle is its computer   system. Without it, no component of the spacecraft could be   adequately tested or monitored. When a Shuttle is being   refurbished after a flight in the Kennedy Space Center's orbiter   Processing Facility, a large double hangar near the landing   runway, the spacecraft's computers are connected to checkout and   launch computers located in a firing room in the Launch Control   Center. When moved to the Vehicle Assembly Building for mating   with its fuel tank and solid propellant boosters, the Shuttle is   reconnected to the firing room. After being transported to the   pad, the final preparations are also controlled from the firing   room. Finally, countdown and launch are executed from the same   firing room. This scenario came after two decades of evolution,   during which the role of computers became dominant both on board   spacecraft and in launch processing. The integrated techniques   exemplified in the Shuttle Launch Processing System developed from   separate automated systems devised for vehicle checkout,   spacecraft checkout, and telemetry monitoring. Important in the   evolution is the part played by on-board computers. The journey   toward full automation got great impetus from the Saturn and   Apollo programs.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">210</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   </FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p210.jpg"   ALT="FIGURE 7-1.
