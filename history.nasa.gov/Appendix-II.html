At the time, programs used on   board spacecraft were either written in assembly languages or in   interpreted languages. The former make programs difficult to write   and maintain, and the latter are insufficiently robust and slow.   Also, future systems were expected to be much larger and more   complex, and cost would be moderated by the use of a high-level   language.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Since NASA directed the development of the   language from the start, it influenced the final form it took and   specifically how it handled the special needs of real-time   processing. Statements common to other high-level languages such   as FORTRAN and PL/1 were put in HAL. These included decision   statements such as IF and looping statements such as FOR, DO, and   WHILE. NASA added to the list of statements several specifically   designed to create real-time processes, such as WAIT, SCHEDULE,   PRIORITY, and TERMINATE. The objective was to make HAL quickly   understandable to any programmer who had worked in other languages   and to give a variety of tools for developing the new real-time   programs. To make the language more readable by engineers, HAL   lists source in such a way as to retain traditional notation, with   subscripts and superscripts in their correct position, as   contrasted with other languages, which force such notation onto a   single level (see Fig. II-I.)</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In addition to new statements, HAL   provided for new types of program blocks. Two of these specific to   real-time processing are COMPOOL and TASK. "Compools" are   declarations of data to be kept in a common data area, thus making   the data accessible to more than one process at a time. It was   expected that several processes would be active at once and that   many data items would need to he dynamically shared. Task blocks   are programs nested within larger programs that execute as   real-time processes dependent on one of the most powerful HAL   statements, SCHEDULE.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Scheduling the execution of specific tasks   was simplified by the syntax of HAL. Fig. II-2 shows the final   page of the procedure STARTUP, written for use on the Galileo   spacecraft attitude control computers, containing the master   scheduling for the entire program. Note that the components of the   SCHEDULE statement are the task name, start time, priority, and   frequency. The statement "SCHEDULE ERROR0 ON RUPT0 PRIORITY(22);"   tells the operating system to execute the task ERROR0 when an   interrupt named RUPT0 occurs with a relative priority of 22. A   different form of the SCHEDULE statement is "SCHEDULE RGl   PRIORITY(12), REPEAT EVERY 6.190," which initiates the task   handling the highest frequency rate group and repeats it 15 times   per second. The statement TERMINATE cancels a specified task upon   a designated interrupt or time.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">HAL did not have the widespread use NASA   had hoped for when the language was designed. Although the Shuttle   on-board programs are exclusively in HAL, the Galileo attitude   control system is the only other flight project to make   significant use of the language. Other projects, though instructed   to use HAL, found reasons to avoid it, although the Deep Space   Network applied it to some ground software. In late 1985, NASA   announced that the language of choice for the upcoming Space   Station project would be Ada. Commissioned by the Department of   Defense in the late 1970s to serve as a standard for all   contractor software development, Ada includes real-time constructs   pioneered by HAL such as task blocks, scheduling, and common data.   The announcement made NASA the first nonmilitary agency to use   Ada. Ada was adopted because commercial compilers were available   and because the DoD's insistence on its use meant that it would be   around for a long time. It appears that HAL will be phased out,   destined to join the hundreds of other dead computer   languages.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">More information on the HAL/S language is   contained in the following sources:</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">- Intermetrics, Inc., HAL/S-360 Compiler   System Specification, Version IR-60-7, February 23,1981.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">- Intermetrics, Inc, HAL/S Language   Specification, Version IR-542, September 1980.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">- Intermetrics, Inc., HAL/S Programmer's   Guide, Version IR-63-5, December 1981.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">- Ryer, Michael J., Programming in   HAL/SIntermetrics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, 1978.</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><DL>   <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   FIGURE II-1</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p395.jpg"   ALT="FIGURE II-1" WIDTH=1177 HEIGHT=1583 X-SAS-UseImageWidth   X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   &nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   FIGURE II-I (continued)</FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p396.jpg"   ALT="FIGURE II-I (continued)" WIDTH=1165 HEIGHT=1747   X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom></FONT>   </CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   </FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Figure II-2</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p397.jpg"   ALT="Figure II-2" WIDTH=1125 HEIGHT=1264 X-SAS-UseImageWidth   X-SAS-UseImageHeight ALIGN=bottom>&nbsp;   <HR>   </FONT></CENTER></P></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Appendix-I.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="contents.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Appendix-III.html"><IMG SRC="Next.gif"ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
