Expanding the memory to 512 words did not require a change   in the logic.

Still, the old fixed sequencer remained in   charge of the Mars orbit insertion burn. After the spacecraft   established orbits, however, the ground control center used the   new sequencer to control the imaging of Mars and its moons. The   expanded memory proved sufficient. Preflight estimates for Mariner   VIII specified 150 words of memory and 225 words for Mariner IX,   yet both grew to over 400 words in flight</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">30</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The mission that used the sequencer to its   limits was Mariner Venus Mercury 1973, or Mariner X.

Adrian Hooke of JPL, one of the project's   managers, decided to use planned memory updates at regular   intervals. He also instituted a "suspenders and belt" approach to   reliability. The sequencer would not only carry a detailed program   for the next mission phase but also a constantly updated bare   minimum program to complete the mission if the spacecraft lost   contact with the ground. If a command was not received for a   certain time, then the sequencer would follow whatever commands   were in the backup program. Thus, software moved ahead in leap   frog fashion. During the earth-moon phase the Venus backup was   loaded, during the Venus encounter the backup Mercury encounter   sequence was on board, and so on</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">32</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Software development was assigned to three   programmers. Ronald Spriestersbach of JPL wrote the near-earth and   post-Mercury sequences, George Elliot of the Boeing Company did   the Venus encounter, and Larry Koga of JPL wrote all three Mercury   encounters</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">33</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the 1969 missions, most changes and   subroutines were hand-coded and used once. By 1971, the COMGEN   ground computer program that produced memory loads for the   Sequencer could develop blocks of commands that functioned much   like subroutines in a standard computer program or macros in an   assembly language program</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">34</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> . In 1973, COMGEN resided in an IBM 360/75 computer   that generated the commands and sent them via the NASA   communications net to the appropriate Deep Space Network station   for transmission. By this time, each station had a command   computer, thus ending the voice/manual era</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">35</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Another improvement to the Sequencer was that   engineers could do memory checks by comparing a sumword stored in   location 512 to the result of summing the first 511 locations. If   a miscompare occurred, then a location-by-location check for error   could be made</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">36</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The improvements both in the Sequencer and   in programming and ground control techniques were not enough to   ensure its use beyond the Mariner series of spacecraft. In spite   of the success of the long and complicated mission of Mariner X,   JPL's Hooke complained that memory limits were too costly due to   excessive need for optimization and constant relocation of   subroutines</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">37</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Besides, the sequencers, regardless of their full   name, were not computers. Spacecraft needed to do on-board   computations, to have more room for software (and, thus, increased   flexibility), and to use the central computer for other functions   such as spacecraft health and safety monitoring done on other   manned and unmanned spacecraft. Some missions intrinsically needed   computers, as, for example, the Viking Mars orbiters and landers   and the Voyager outer planet probes. The computer eventually   designed, built, and used for the Viking Orbiter had its roots in   the programmable sequencer, but it also owed some [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">149</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] concepts, at   least in comparison, to a computer built in the research side of   JPL and aimed at the long-duration, complex missions of the   future. The story of that computer research project adds a   necessary perspective for understanding the direction JPL's   on-board computer development took in the 1970s.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch5-3.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch5-5.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
