A projected fleet of three orbiters would be limited to a   maximum 2-week turnaround between flights and a 2-hour countdown   in order to achieve that many firings</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">39</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Compared to the 5-month checkout of a Saturn V and   its 3-day countdowns, this seemed outrageous, especially since the   Shuttle would be no simpler than an Apollo/Saturn. NASA put   considerable effort into examining commercial aircraft maintenance   techniques to see what could be adopted for Shuttle use. One study   indicated that only 53% of the tests done on a Saturn V would need   be repeated if the spacecraft were reusable</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">40</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

As Henry Paul, who headed the Launch Processing   System development for NASA, said, "Automation...becomes a   requirement for operations, not an elective"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">43</A></FONT></SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> Still, some   engineers needed to be convinced that hardwired testing could be   successfully eliminated, even though the last 20 hours of a Saturn   countdown was 85% automated</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">44</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Building the present system, during which almost   all preflight testing and preparation is done under control of   software, and in which much of the countdown, sometimes even   including the calling of "holds," is done by computing machinery,   was a remarkable effort</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">45</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. One of the biggest changes from the Apollo/Saturn   preflight checkout systems is that Kennedy Space Center became   responsible for the development of the Launch Processing System.   Given the organization of NASA at the time, this was one of the   biggest surprises as well.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Kennedy Space Center Gets the   Job</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">During the late 1960s NASA began studies   of the configuration of the eventual STS. Most designs were   predicated on a winged booster, which would return to the launch   site immediately after separation from an orbiter with internal   fuel tanks. Such a design could theoretically be launched from   anywhere in the United States isolated enough to handle aborts   safely. Project staff examined a number of sites and made   projections of the cost of an "ideal launch [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">224</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] site" that would   have all the facilities necessary for handling the Shuttle. Chief   among these were a hypergolic and cryogenic fuels facility, a   hangar for the orbiters and boosters, a mating building, a control   center, the launch pads, and a runway with a safing bay for   emptying residual fuels after landing. One study placed the cost   of a new facility with these characteristics at $1.9 billion. On   the other hand, modifying existing Apollo/Saturn facilities at   Kennedy and adding new equipment where needed would cost $355   million, a significant savings</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">46</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. In March 1972, NASA selected the solid rocket   booster/external tank configuration for the Shuttle. All inland   launch sites were thus eliminated, and just Kennedy Space Center,   Vandenberg Air Force Base, and a site in Texas remained under   consideration</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">47</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Since existing facilities could be modified at   both Vandenberg and Kennedy, the cost-conscious administrators   settled on those two launch sites. Vandenberg was expected to   handle polar orbit launches and most military payloads. Kennedy   would launch eastward, continuing the established situation and   giving Kennedy the opportunity to try for the development of the   checkout system.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Phase B Shuttle studies conducted by a   number of contractors included concepts of the checkout   system</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">48</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Some hinted at the direction the eventual system   would take. One pointed out the need for efficient and simple   man-machine interfaces, and called for having ATOLL, FORTRAN IV,   and COBOL compilers available to the engineers</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">49</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Kennedy's own early study, based on Rockwell and   McDonnell-Douglas Shuttle configurations, called for a central   data processing facility connected to every part of the Shuttle   handling equipment, including a mission simulator on site and by   communications link to Mission Control in   Houston</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">50</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Meanwhile, remnants of the old ACE group at   Johnson had started work on a Shuttle checkout system.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">A "Checkout Systems Development Lab" at   the Johnson Space Center did research on new concepts of preparing   manned spacecraft for flight</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">51</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Individual BIC, for "built-in checkout," cells   would be located at test points throughout a spacecraft, each cell   with I/O registers. Automated tests would read and write to these   cells. Johnson's development team wanted a single central computer   to be connected to several sets of Universal Test Equipment   consoles and thence to the Shuttle</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">52</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. General Electric built a prototype of a "Universal   Control and Display Console" for the Laboratory. Each control   console would have two color display tubes and be capable of   supporting tests on any specified parts of the   spacecraft</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">53</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The system was similar to earlier Apollo/Saturn   concepts, with a big computer in the middle doing all the testing   and displays, communicating with the spacecraft, and so on. One   improvement was that the Universal Test Equipment meant that units   could be mass produced and assigned to different checkout tasks   without significant hardware changes. When [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">225</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] the time came   for the Shuttle project office at Johnson to make a decision about   preflight checkout, the hometown lab made a proposal that was   "underdeveloped" and vague</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">54</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Most likely, the engineers in the Development Lab   thought the job was theirs because in all previous programs the   center responsible for the spacecraft was responsible for   checkout. When Kennedy had tried to do some ACE development, it   was moved to the center responsible for the Apollo. Therefore, a   full- blown proposal did not seem necessary. They were in for a   surprise.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Impetus to make Kennedy the development   center for the Launch Processing System came from many levels. The   center's director, Kurt Debus, made his support clear to his   engineers in 1972</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">55</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Walton saw a chance to do another ACE, but this   time as a fully integrated system for all parts of the spacecraft.   The consensus was that by having Kennedy Space Center do the   development, much money would be saved and civil servants would be   more actively involved</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">56</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Even though the work originated with Walton's   Design Engineering Directorate, talent for developing the Launch   Processing System came from across the Center</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">57</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. A study group of about half a dozen engineers, led   by Theodore Sasseen and including Henry Paul, Frank Bryne, George   Matthews, and others who had key roles in the later implementation   of the system, met and began work on a   prototype</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">58</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Making the prototype turned out to be one   of the key factors in landing the Launch Processing System   development job for Kennedy. The engineers made a small model of a   liquid hydrogen loading facility, with real valves and tanks.   Using a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 11/45, they devised   software that graphically displayed a skeletal view of the piping   and valves, with actual pressures printed next to the appropriate   valve. The prototype could transfer fuel to the model spacecraft   under software control, with the user able to monitor flows and   pressures at the console. Confidence in their ability to create   automated procedures encouraged the engineers, and they also now   had a physical version of their system to help in selling it.   Johnson's Universal Test Equipment had no counterpart in terms of   functionality.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The prototype represented a single, and   complete, part of the total system, a system quite different in   concept from previous ideas. Launch processing and mission control   prior to the Kennedy developments were based on using a minimum   number of mainframe computers. Frank Byrne had the technical   vision to develop a distributed computing system, in which dozens   of small computers would do the checkout functions. Walton   provided the leadership and tenacity to hold to the concept and   see it put into place</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">59</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Several important advantages result from using   distributed computers. First, the tasks more closely fit the power   of the machine. Using a mainframe computer for relatively simple   procedures such as solid rocket booster checkout would be   overkill</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">60</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Second, a distributed system would free software   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">226</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   developers from worrying about fitting their programs in with   others in a big machine's memory. Each discipline, such as   engines, cryogenics, and avionics, would have a separate   console</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">61</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Third, parallel testing could be   done</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">62</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. A mainframe would have to be inordinately large to   contain all the checkout programs. Therefore, they would have to   be loaded and run serially, as in the RCA 110As, defeating the   short countdown requirement. Finally, Paul was convinced that   overall hardware costs would be reduced compared with mainframe   configurations</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">63</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1972 Robert F.

The Processing System itself is   largely contained in the Launch Control Center. Hardware is   divided into the Checkout, Control, and Monitor Subsystem (CCMS),   the Central Data Subsystem (CDS), and the Record and Playback   Subsystem (RPS). Small, task-dedicated computers are in the four   firing rooms of the Control Center and are the primary component   of the CCMS. Large mainframe computers located on the floor below   the firing rooms make up the biggest part of the CDS. NASA's   Joseph Medlock, Thomas Purer, and Larry [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">227</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Dickison   envisioned test engineers developing their own procedures using an   engineer-oriented language like ATOLL in concept but better and   easier to use</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">68</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. These procedures would then be developed on the   mainframes and tested against simulations stored on the   mainframes. When verified, they would be included in the system   and stored on disk.

At each   location, hardware interface modules make it possible to test and   monitor the orbiter and other parts of the spacecraft from the   firing rooms.

Frank Byrne, who was   involved in the planning for the Processing System from the start,   took on the job of designing a device to keep track of commonly   needed data that also made it possible for the various computers   to communicate with each other. Kennedy followed a plan to use   commercially available equipment in as many parts of the Launch   Processing System as possible. Minicomputers and mainframe   computers are used largely unchanged. However, since no   organization had tried to closely connect such large numbers of   machines, some of which were quite different in architecture from   the others, there was no commercially available solution to the   common data problem. Byrne had to design one on his own: the   common data buffer.</FONT></P>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Byrne noted that as the number of   computers in a distributed system increases, the complexity of   intercomputer communication increases. He wanted to remove the   complexity. By placing the common data at a central location he   eliminated the need to update multiple copies of the data in   separate machine memories. Possibly he got the idea for a common   data area from his work on the GE 635s in the Central   Instrumentation Facility. Those machines had a "data core"   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">230</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   which could be accessed by both</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">84</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. ACE stations also used common data areas.   Basically the common data buffer provides each machine in the   system with a set of "post office boxes." Specific parameters,   such as valve pressures, voltages, and fuel levels, are assigned a   location in the buffer memory. Each machine can read any location   in the memory, but only the machines explicitly assigned to the   task of maintaining a certain parameter can write to that   parameter's location. That way a secondary machine cannot   spuriously change a parameter's value. Programmers do not have to   worry about where any particular parameter is kept. As long as it   is referred to by its proper name in a GOAL program, the system   build process will assign it its correct address as the program is   compiled and integrated. In addition to acting as a common storage   area for data, the buffer maintains the entire system interrupt   stack and flags and status variables. Since it is centrally   located, it is also used to temporarily store application programs   as they are loaded from the repository in the CDS to the   individual minicomputers. As such, it acts as a "way   station."</FONT></DL><P><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></P><DL>   <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR>   </FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Box 7-1: Inside the Common Data   Buffer</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even though the common data buffer is a   unique design, it uses standard commercial chips and boards.   Nothing was custom built</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">85</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Micros,   especially, can be connected to common data bases on shared hard   disks. NCR Corporation briefly marketed a system called Modus from   1982 to 1984 that featured the ability to connect with different   types of microcomputers, a shared data base, and microprocessor   control of communications that effectively locked out other   computers from corrupting data being updated by another one on the   network.

[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">238</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] With hundreds of   Shuttle flights planned to carry a variety of payloads from all   over the world, the process of properly integrating cargo with the   orbiter is a large task. Both electronic and physical interfaces   must be checked in order to verify, for example, that a Spacelab   module built in Germany will properly fit to a vacuum-proof seal   in the cargo bay and be able to "talk" to the Shuttle computers as   well.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Soon after beginning work as the prime   contractor, Rockwell International and NASA did a study to find   out how much and what kind of Interface Verification Equipment   (IVE) would be needed for the operations era. By doing things the   "traditional" way, in which the payload supplier did the interface   verification, an estimated 20 sets of very expensive equipment   were required. Robert Thompson favored sense over politics and   decided in early 1976 to let Kennedy develop a centralized version   of the IVE and do all the final interface testing for all the   customers</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">133</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">During June, July, and August of 1976 the   formal requirements for the cargo facility were baselined. But   when a source selection board met to begin choosing equipment, the   members realized that they were about to violate the basic   principles of the Launch Processing System by bringing in new   equipment and doing things in a unique way instead of using   existing contracts and computers</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">134</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Accordingly, Kennedy stocked the cargo facility   with the same physical and electronic interfaces present in the   orbiter, permitting the same contractors and maintenance contracts   to be used. In 1978, an AP-101 was added to provide a means to   test software interfaces. Equipment in the cargo facility can also   directly connect with the Launch Processing System so that   payloads can be further integrated.

That award marks the end of the multicontractor   development era and the beginning, for the first time in NASA's   history, of an operations era for a manned spacecraft. Before the   Shuttle, each flight and the preparations beforehand were   idiosyncratic. Now some degree of standardization and routine is   possible, largely because of the nature of the Launch Processing   System. Carl Delaune, a NASA engineer in the Applications and   Simulations Branch, is exploring ways of applying artificial   intelligence to checkout procedures, such as creating a program   that makes suggestions to test engineers if strange values   occur</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">137</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

A marvel of integration,   efficiency, and suitability, it reflects the ingenuity and   clear-sightedness of its originators. Lessons learned in the 1960s   during the first attempts at automating checkout were applied in   toto [sic] to the Launch Processing System.
