The controls consisted of a mode switch,   a start button, a malfunction light, a computation light, and a   reset switch. The mode switch had seven positions for selection of   one of the measurement or computation programs. The start button   caused the computer to run the selected program loaded in its   memory. The reset switch caused the computer to execute its   start-up diagnostics and prepare itself for action. The MDIU   consisted of two parts: a 1 0-digit keyboard and a 7-digit   register. The first two digits of the register, a simple   odometerlike rotary display, were used to indicate a memory   address. Up to 99 such logical addresses could be accessed. The   remaining five digits displayed data. Errors caused all zeroes to   appear. Negative numbers were inserted by making the first digit a   nine; the other digits contained the value. The IVI displayed   velocity increments required for, or as a result of, a powered   maneuver. It had three-digit feet-per-second displays for each of   forward-and-back, up-and-down, and left-to-right   axes</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">39</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   &nbsp;[<A NAME="22"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">22</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p22.htm"><IMG   SRC="p22s.jpg" ALT="Figure 1-6.

On orbit, if no powered maneuvers were   imminent, it could be shut down to save electrical power. Due to   the nature of core memory, programs and data stored magnetically   in the cores would not disappear when the power was off, as in   present day semiconductor memories. This made it possible to load   the next set of modules, if necessary, from the Auxiliary Tape   Memory, enter any needed parameters, and then shut down the   machine until shortly before its next use. It took 20 seconds for   the machine to run its start-up diagnostics upon restoration of   power. After the diagnostics ran successfully, the current program   load was ready for use, all parameters intact.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">GT-IV was following such a procedure in   preparing for re-entry on June 7, 1965. The computer was placed in   the RNTY mode, and the crew received and entered updated   parameters given to them when they were in contact with the ground   stations. But when they tried to turn the machine off, the manual   on/off switch did not function. The power had to be cut off by   another means, and the re-entry handled manually   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">40</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Using the computer for catch-up and   rendezvous was a relatively simple task. The difference between   catch-up and rendezvous is that catch-up maneuvers are executed to   put the spacecraft into position to make an orbit-change maneuver.   After the orbit change the spacecraft is prepared to rendezvous   with the target </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">41</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Crews began the catch-up by entering the   ground-calculated rendezvous angle desired into address 83. The   rendezvous angle indicated how much farther along in a 360-degree   orbit the rendezvous was to take place. For example, if the crew   desired rendezvous one-third orbit ahead, 12000 was entered into   address 83 using the MDIU. The interval at which the pilot wanted   to see updates was then entered in address 93. For example, if   04000 was entered, the computer would display on the IVI any   required velocity changes at 120 degrees from the rendezvous point   (the start), 80 degrees to go, and 40 degrees to go. If the IVI   indicated that the computer had calculated that such a rendezvous   was possible within the designated fuel limits, the astronauts   pressed the START button and the IVI displayed the first set of   velocity differentials. The pilot then fired the thrusters until   the displays were all at zero (Astronaut John Young reported that   there was a tendency to "overshoot" in trying to burn to zero   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">42</A></FONT></SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">).

The astronauts also did paper-and-pencil   calculations of the velocity changes as a backup by using special   nomographs based on time and angles to the target   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source1.html">44</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

It permitted   the Gemini astronauts to be independent of the ground in   accomplishing rendezvous from the terminal-phase intercept   maneuver to station keeping, a valuable rehearsal for the lunar   orbit rendezvous required for the Apollo program. The astronauts   participated in both the hardware and software design of the   computer and its interfaces, and they were able to go to Owego and   be put in the man-in-the-loop simulations. By flight time, like   everything else in the cockpit, use of the computer was second   nature.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch1-3.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch1-5.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
