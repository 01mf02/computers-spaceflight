During the period in which the software was   criticized for its complexity, designers attempted to reduce the   number of keystrokes required to execute various programs.

Whereas most computer   commands are entered by typing in the text of the command, the   Apollo computer command list specified verb and noun pairs. There   were 100 two-digit numbers available for each, and most were used   on any given flight. Examples of verb-noun pairs are "display   velocity" and "load angle." Verb 37, for example, was "Change   Prog," which enabled the crew to set up a new program for   execution.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">If, for example, the crew wanted to   execute the rendezvous targeting program, an astronaut would first   press the VERB key followed by the digits 3 and 7, and then the   ENTER key. That sequence informed the computer of a request for a   program change. The astronaut would then press 3, 1, and ENTER to   tell the computer to execute program P31. Within the program the   crew could request maneuver angles (verb 50, noun 18), monitor the   changes while a maneuver was in progress (verb 06, noun 18), or   request the velocity change required for the next maneuver (verb   06, noun 84), among other functions. The CSM G&amp;C Checklist, a   set of "cue cards" on three rings changed for each mission by the   Crew Procedures Division in Houston, described all these sequences   in detail. The document contained reference data, such as a star   list, verb list, noun list, alarm codes, error handling and   recovery, and the checklists for each program carried in the   computer.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Despite the 100 verb-noun pairs, 70-odd   programs and routines, and a very limited user interface that   alternated decimal and octal and blinked for attention, the   consensus is that the Apollo computer was easy to use. As with   other aspects of flying space missions, hours in simulators made   operating the computer second nature. NASA engineer John R. Garman   commented that "it's like playing the piano-- you don't have to   see your fingers to know where they are"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">154</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Familiarity with the computer, remarked astronaut   Eugene Cernan, meant that pressing a wrong key simply and   immediately "felt" wrong</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">155</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Others also confirmed that using the machine   eventually became relatively natural</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">156</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Apollo astronauts were also willing to adapt to   design foibles that would frustrate others. There were concerns   that a crewman initiating a maneuver from the navigator's station   would not be able to return to his couch before the burn started.   In response, Virgil Grissom was accommodating: "Well, we'll just   lie down on the floor"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">157</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Astronauts also tolerated non-life-threatening   software errors not cleared up before flight as merely something   else to endure</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">158</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. They did, however, complain about the annoying   number of keystrokes required during a rendezvous, so designers   modified the software to make a "minkey" (minimum keystroke)   option available, in which the computer could perform some   functions without constant crew approval</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">159</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.
