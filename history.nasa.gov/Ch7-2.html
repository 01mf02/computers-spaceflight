No earthly booster since the Skylab launch   has been as large or as powerful. Shuttles being mated in the   Vehicle Assembly Building originally designed for the Saturn   appeared as dwarfs in houses made for giants. It looked as though   there was nearly enough room to stack them two high. The dread   came from the fear of failure among the thousands of components,   many capable of bringing disaster and killing a crew in flight.   Early in the Saturn program automation began to be introduced in   the testing of the gargantuan rockets. Marshall Space Flight   Center acquired computers for Saturn vehicle checkout. Marshall   also had responsibility for the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer   (LVDC) housed in the Instrument Unit that [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">211</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] was the last   stage below the Apollo spacecraft on both Saturn IB and Saturn V   configurations. NASA's Launch Operations Center, later renamed   Kennedy Space Center, acquired computers for telemetry data   reduction and display and began work on the checkout systems used   for the Apollo spacecraft, a project later transferred to the   Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. Each of these   computer-controlled systems contributed to the concepts and   development of the Shuttle Launch Processing System, now wholly   based at the Kennedy Space Center.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Checkout of the Saturn   Vehicle</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville   had primary responsibility for the design, manufacture, and flight   preparation of the Saturn vehicles. In 1951, when Marshall was   still the headquarters of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Kurt   H. Debus formed a launch team that commuted to the Air Force's   Eastern Test Range in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Within a short   period of time, the frequency of launches made it necessary to   establish a permanent group at the Cape, called the Missile Firing   Laboratory. When Marshall was established on July 1, 1960, the   Laboratory was renamed the Launch Operations Directorate. By 1962,   the activities at Cape Canaveral grew to the level that the Launch   Operations Center was formed separately from Marshall and given   status equal to other NASA centers. However, its charter stated   that the centers responsible for a particular vehicle or   spacecraft had to perform its checkout and test, so during the   Apollo era Marshall prepared Saturns and the Manned Spacecraft   Center worked on the Apollos.

At that time, computers were seldom used for   on-line work, and most engineers were still unfamiliar with them   and wary of any more innovations in an already innovative program.   However, Chrysler converted some factory tests to automatic, using   a special language, "HYLA," to define them. Additionally, several   Packard Bell computers connected to a common memory automatically   checked out parts of the Saturn I. Use of a common memory as a   computer interconnection device reappeared in several later   systems and is critical to the success of the Shuttle's Launch   Processing System.

By   late 1962, the Saturn V stage contractors accepted the concept of   automatic checkout and settled on a common system, the Control   Data Corporation CDC-924A computer, as the factory test machine,   with 110As assigned to the S-I stage and for the assembled vehicle   at the launch site</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">14</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></P>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">By this time, it was clear to Ludie   Richard, a NASA engineer, and his team at Marshall that preparing   a language to help test engineers write automated procedures was   the key to continued acceptance of the principle.

IBM eventually wrote routines for the RCA   computers in assembly language, but the majority of the automated   tests were ATOLL (Acceptance, Test, or Launch Language) programs   stored on tape.

At Launch   Complex 34, the Saturn IB launch site, one master RCA 110A was in   the blockhouse and a slave underground at the pad. For Saturn Vs   at Complex 39, one RCA 110A was located in each of the four firing   rooms in the Saturn Launch Control Center, which was attached to   the Vehicle Assembly Building in which the Saturns would be   stacked. Each of four mobile launchers also contained a computer.   In addition to the 110As, the firing rooms also had a DDP-224   minicomputer as a display driver for the CRTs showing output data   to the engineers, as well as a controller for slides and other   visuals. Computers in the mobile launchers could be used for   checkout in the Assembly Building as well as at the pads, a   foreshadowing of the later Launch Processing System. Due to   reliability problems with the 110As, the launcher computers used a   dual memory configuration.

GE   had long been out of the computer business by then, having sold   its digital computer division to Honeywell in the early 1970s.   Kennedy retained a permanent systems programmer from GE (who later   moved to Honeywell) to keep the operating systems going and used a   retired blockhouse 635 from Wallops Island as a source of   parts</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">30</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

When Kennedy Space Center   officials searched for a second machine for the Central   Instrumentation Facility, they considered other vendors. IBM's   branch manager in Cape Canaveral, W. O.

Any changes impacted on the execution time, and   therefore had to be carefully integrated. The computer could not   handle waiting for an interrupt to instigate an action. Actions   had to be initiated by the program relative to its starting time.   When the ASC-15 gave way to the LVDC, a more powerful and flexible   machine, programmers continued in the monolithic mode. Finally,   IBM staff realized that by preparing the software in essentially   free-standing chunks, the impact of changes would be limited to   the modules and not spread side effects throughout the software.   This discovery came late in the Saturn program but   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">222</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   early enough to affect the development of the Skylab on-board   software. Also, IBM separated the modules into groups consisting   of the control subsystem and applications subsystem, which is a   prototype of the Shuttle on-board software   organization</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">34</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. IBM helped transfer this concept to the Shuttle by   moving people such as Kyle Rone and Lynn Killingbeck from working   on the Saturn computer directly to the Houston office to support   the Shuttle software development. NASA also independently moved   toward modularization when, in 1973, it broke down the programs   used on the GE 635s to support telemetry data reduction. Before   then, it took an average of 3 months to implement a simple change   in the monolithic version of the program, because of the massive   debugging necessary to eliminate side effects</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source7.html">35</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Thus, modularization came to be expected by NASA   as part of software design. If modularization was not used on the   Shuttle on-board software, preparing new flight loads would have   been impossible within the projected time between flights of an   individual orbiter.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Besides modularization, Apollo/Saturn   significantly influenced IBM's later work on the Shuttle's   on-board software, especially the company's design of the system   used for Shuttle launch processing.

In regard to consolidating all   functions in one computer, IBM thought that the difficulties of   integrating the two RCA computers, the DDP-224 display computer,   and the telemetry reduction computers were excessive. By taking   that position, IBM found itself squared off against the   distributed concepts envisioned by Tom Walton and his team for the   Shuttle system. Walton refused to move to Houston when Shea   transferred the ACE team. By staying at Kennedy, he was able to   influence the structure of the Shuttle Launch Processing System   and help make the Center fully responsible for all checkout and   launch operations for the entire vehicle, a significant change   from the Apollo/Saturn program.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR>   <A NAME="7-2a"></A></FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">*</FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"> For a   complete description of the evolution of the Saturn and its   components, see Roger Bilstein, </FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/sp4206.htm">Stages   to Saturn: A Technological History of the Apollo/Saturn Launch   Vehicles</A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">, NASA SP-4206, 1980.   Chapter 8 centers on the use of computers in checkout and the   development of the Instrument Unit and its flight computer.   Chapter 16 of Charles D.
