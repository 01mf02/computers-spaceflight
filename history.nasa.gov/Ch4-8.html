The revised computer uses a Motorola 68000 32-bit   microprocessor. When selected, it was clearly the state of the   art. Instead of plated wire, a CMOS-type semiconductor   random-access memory is used. Finally, the software is written in   the high-level programming language, C. Such a computer reflects   the current design and components of a ground-based, powerful   digital control system. The C language is also known as an   excellent tool for software systems development. In fact, the UNIX   operating system is coded in it.</FONT></P>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aside from the processor change, the Block   II's memory was increased to 64K words. Therefore, the entire   controller software, including preflight routines, can be loaded   at one time. Semiconductor memories have the advantages of high   speed, lower power consumption, and higher density than core, but   lack core memory's ability to retain data when power is shut off.   Reliability of the memory in the Block II computer was assured by   replicating the 64K and providing a three-tier power   supply</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">184</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Both Channel A and Channel B have two sets of 64K   memories, each loaded with identical software. Failure in one   causes a switch-over to the other. This protects against hardware   failures in the memory chips. The three tiers of power protect   against losing memory. The first level of power is the standard   115-volt primary supply. If it fails, a pair of 28-volt backup   supplies, one for each channel, is available from other components   of the system. Last, a battery backup, standard on most   earth-based computer systems, can preserve memory but not run the   processor.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The significance of the evolution to Block   II engine controllers is that they represent the first use of   semiconductor memories and microprocessors in a life-critical   component of a manned spacecraft. Honeywell scheduled delivery of   a breadboard version suitable for testing in mid-1985. The new   controller is physically the same length and width, so it fits the   old mounting. The depth is expected to be somewhat less. When the   first of these computers flies on a Shuttle, NASA will have   skipped from 1968 computer technology to 1982 technology in one   leap.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">IBM's new version of the AP-101 (the F)   incorporates some of the same advantages gained by the new   technology of the engine controllers. Increasing the memory to   256K words means that the ascent, on-orbit, and descent software   can be fitted into the memory all at once. (This is not likely to   happen, however, because of the pressing need to improve the crew   interfaces and expand existing functions.) Higher component   density allows the CPU and IOP to be fitted into one box roughly   the size and weight of either of their predecessors. Execution   speed is now accelerated to nearly 1 million operations per   second, twice the original value. In essence, NASA has finally   acquired the power and capability it wanted in 1972, before the   software requirements showed the inadequacy of the original   AP-101.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">133</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] As in the engine   controllers, the memory in the AP-101F is made of semiconductors.   Power can be applied to the memory even when the central processor   is shut down so as to keep the stored programs from disappearing.   A commercially available error detection and correcting chip is   included to constantly scan the memory and correct single bit   errors. These precautions help eliminate the disadvantage of   volatility while still preserving the size, power, and weight   advantages of using semiconductors over core memories   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">185</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch4-7.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch4-9.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
