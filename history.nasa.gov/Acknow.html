In a project of this size and length, many people, both   within NASA and outside it, contributed mightily or it would never   have been either finished or of its present quality.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In the NASA History Office, Sylvia D.   Fries as Director was a great help not only in accommodating   several schedule changes but in actively critiquing early   chapters. Her best management decision was assigning Michal   McMahon as the editor. He treated the volume as his own and spent   many hours turning turgidity into something resembling smooth   text. Monte Wright, former Director, is to be thanked for granting   the contract in the first place, and Edward C. Ezell, for his help   in Houston during the proposal phase when he was head of the   History Office at the Johnson Space Center.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">At The Wichita State University, my   department chair, Mary Edgington, tried to keep excessive demands   from overwhelming me during the 3 years I was funded under the   contract. Lawrence Smith of the research office took care of the   paperwork. Five assistants helped at one time or another in the   research or writing phase. Dana Hamit acted as keeper of the   bibliography for a year, and created the initial data bases I used   while writing. Kim Allen took over from her and prepared the final   version of the notes from the first three chapters, as well as   acting as first editor. Linda Manfull brought the bibliographic   data base into final shape and did the notes for Chapter Four.   Maria Dreisziger helped with the notes for Chapters Five and Six,   and identified terms for the glossary. Tamera Klausmeyer typed the   notes for Chapters Seven through Nine, as well as finishing   identifying terms for the glossary.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In my travels during the research phase I   was privileged to meet and work with a large number of NASA and   contractor personnel. Those listed in the bibliographic note as   granting interviews usually shared rare materials from their files   as well. Some were asked to do technical reviews of individual   chapters or sections of chapters to help eliminate as many errors   of fact and interpretation as possible. Those who did this double   duty included Bill Bailey, Ed Blizzard, Frank Byrne, Bill Chubb,   Sam Deese, Dwain Deets, Bob Ernull, Jack Garman, Ray Hartenstein,   Helmut Hoelzer, Carl Johnson, Ted Kopf, Ken Mansfield, Russ   Mattox, Ann Merwarth, Bob Nathan, Henry Paul, Dick Rice, Bill   Stewart, Tom Taylor, Bill Tindall, Chuck Trevathan, Paul   Westmoreland, John Wooddell, and John Young.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">At each site individuals opened doors for   me and found office space where none was available. I want to   especially thank Wanda Thrower of Johnson Space Center, Bob   Sheppard of Marshall [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">xii</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Flight Center,   Harriet Brown and Mike Konjevich of Kennedy Space Center, and   Andrew Danni of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for their   hospitality. Frank Penovich of Kennedy was especially helpful in   obtaining a tour of the Shuttle facilities.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">After the termination of the actual   contract, I spent a year and a half at the Software Engineering   Institute (SKI) located at CarnegieMellon University. The SKI was   kind enough to permit use of their equipment to assist in   preparing the final drafts of the manuscript. My assistants   Katherine Harvey and Suzanne Woolf did yeoman work editing and   formatting the text for laser printing.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">My thanks also goes to my wife, who   lovingly never let me give up.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">A final, required, word from our sponsor:   This work was mostly done under NASA Contract NASW-37 14.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Preface.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="contents.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Computing.html"><IMG SRC="Next.gif"ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
