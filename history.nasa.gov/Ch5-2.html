Most space probes look like   multiarmed Hindu gods in flight due to the need to expose solar   panels, point antennas, and deploy imaging equipment, but they   must be folded to fit into the nose fairing of a rocket. During   the launch period the spacecraft is injected into its transfer   orbit to intercept the target, deploys its various appendages into   their proper positions, and orients itself. A decision was made   early at JPL to build spacecraft that would be stabilized in three   axes during flight</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">1</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Spacecraft would be oriented by using the sun,   earth, and/or a star as a reference. If kept from tumbling they   would always be pointed in a specific direction. A key advantage   of this plan is that a directional antenna could be used for   earth-space communications, reducing power requirements. Imaging   equipment could also be more stable than on a spin-stabilized   spacecraft such as a Pioneer. A disadvantage of three-axis   stabilization is that a fairly sophisticated attitude control   system must be carried, including a sensor system to find the sun   and a guide star. Part of the launch phase, then, is spent   scanning the sky for Campus, Vega, or whatever star has been   chosen for aligning the spacecraft.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The mid-course maneuver phase often comes   only a day or two after initial transfer orbit insertion in order   to correct relatively large [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">142</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] injection   errors. Consisting of a timed burn of the spacecraft's propulsion   system in each of three axes, it serves a number of purposes.   Early launches could not depend upon the launch vehicle to   establish a adequate flight path. Later, as booster guidance   improved, probes were purposely aimed to miss the target so as to   avoid contaminating planetary atmospheres with earthly bacteria   hitching a ride on a spacecraft if the spacecraft ceased to   function during launch and could not change its path to miss the   planet. Therefore, the mid-course burn took place to correct the   path of a "live" spacecraft. On long-duration missions with   several targets, such as the Voyager probe to Jupiter, Saturn,   Uranus, and Neptune, this maneuver might be repeated before and   after each encounter. Engine firings are made before encounter to   improve the accuracy of the trajectory to achieve a better gravity   assist from the target planet to the new trajectory and reduce the   size of the post encounter maneuvers.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Less is done on the spacecraft during the   cruise period than in any other mission phase. However, recent   larger and more complicated spacecraft have particle and fields   experiments that run constantly and engineering calibrations that   need periodic attention. If the spacecraft attitude is disturbed,   reorientation may be necessary. This period of relative quiet ends   when the encounter sequences begin as the spacecraft nears its   target. Instruments must be turned on, calibrated and aimed.   Imaging instrument pointing must be programmed and controlled.   Data must be recorded and transmitted to earth. Of course, these   activities are repeated during multiple encounter missions.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Initiating the functions done in each   phase requires on-board control. This was unnecessary for Ranger   missions to the moon, which were simple impact flights with   televised imaging during the last minutes. Because maximum   speed-of-light delay in radio signals to the moon is less than a   second, near-real-time commanding could be done. Ground commands   could fire engines, point the spacecraft, and turn on cameras.   Ranger flights used a voice/manual commanding system for this.   Desired instructions were developed and formatted at JPL and then   delivered by telephone to the Deep Space Network station currently   in contact with the spacecraft. An operator would thumb-wheel the   octal codes into a panel called the "Read-Write-Verify Console,"   sending them to the spacecraft after   verification</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">2</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Such care was not always enough. On Ranger III, a   guidance error caused the spacecraft to miss the moon by 23,000   miles. Although JPL flight controllers were able to get images   during the flyby, a documentation discrepancy between the command   set developed during the ground testing of the spacecraft and the   flight set caused Ranger to point the wrong way, returning images   of open space</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">3</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ranger carried a "Central Computer and   Sequencer" to back up the direct command system. Activated before   lift-off, it counted the hours, minutes, and seconds until a   specified mission event was to [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">143</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] occur and then   executed a set of commands that performed the required functions.   If the uplink radio channel failed, the mission would proceed   according to a prepared plan. This assumed optimum performance,   turning on the cameras regardless of where the spacecraft might be   actually pointing. Still, it provided a bit of insurance for the   mission.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">At the same time that the Rangers were   being built, JPL designed and flew the first Mariners. Mariner's   initial mission was a Venus flyby launched in 1962. In the case of   this spacecraft and its later brethren, the Central Computer and   Sequencer was the prime source of commands, at least for cruise   and encounter portions of the mission</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">4</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The time delay for commands to travel to Venus and   Mars defeats real-time control from the ground. For Mariner II, at   launch time minus 15 minutes, the clock was set so that the   encounter sequence would begin at 12 hours from the closest   approach to Venus. The sequencer's clock, a very accurate   oscillator similar to computer clocks today, started at launch   time minus 3 minutes</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">5</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Direct commanding capability was maintained. When   the star tracker got confused and locked onto the wrong target,   ground controllers could reinitiate a search</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">6</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Direct command could also be used for midcourse   maneuvers. As a complement to direct command, "quantitative"   commands could be sent to the sequencer for later   use</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">7</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. For instance, times such as "51 seconds of minus   roll" and "795 seconds of minus pitch" or burn times could be   inserted into the memory for later execution</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">8</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Mariners could abandon direct command and go to   automatic command if a radio failure was detected. On the Mariner   Mars 1964 spacecraft the sequencer contained a cyclic command that   checked for such a failure at 66 2/3 hour intervals, effecting an   auto switch-over</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">9</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The Mariner II spacecraft to Venus (1962),   Mariner IV to Mars (1964), and Mariner V to Venus (1967) carried   the same Central Computer and Sequencer. Just one flew on each   mission, due to space and weight restrictions, even though the   machine weighed in at 11.5 pounds</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">10</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. However, with the direct command capability   intact, each had essentially the same level of redundancy as the   Gemini and Apollo spacecraft, with their single-processor on-board   computer systems and ground control computers. Plans for Mariner   Mars 1969 called for a larger spacecraft and a more ambitious   mission: two picture-taking flybys of different portions of the   "red planet". JPL's Neil H. Herman, who had headed development of   the Sequencer, saw an opportunity to improve the device for the   upcoming flights</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">11</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. One aim was to give the new spacecraft more   flexibility. If the first flyby turned up something special, it   would be very useful if the second spacecraft could be   reprogrammed in flight to take advantage of lessons learned on the   initial pass</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">12</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This actually happened during the missions when   reprogramming was accomplished for Mariner VII's [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">144</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] August 5, 1969   flyby in response to Mariner VI's July 31   passage</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">13</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Another reason for more on board autonomy is that   command sessions for the Mariners lasted as long as 8 hours!   Mariner's command rate was l bit per second, so long sequences   were expensive both in personnel time and Deep Space Network   time</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">14</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The availability of more space and weight plus the   desire for flexibility and greater autonomy caused JPL to change   the Sequencer to make it more of a computer and less of what it   really was, a fixed-program counter.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   </FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p144.jpg"   ALT="Figure 5-1.
