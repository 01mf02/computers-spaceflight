The need for these three attributes   has caused NASA and its contractors to devise new techniques for   computer applications, such as operating systems for mainframe   computers capable of handling real-time processing and   sophisticated networking. Through these developments NASA has had   its largest impact on computing in the commercial world.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Differences between ground-based computers   and on-board computers center on the relative ease of hardware   procurement with the continued difficulty of software development.   On-board computers evolved from custom-made systems to the largely   off-the-shelf Skylab and Shuttle computers. Ground computers   followed a more conventional line, as they could be, from the   beginning, commercially available systems, though applied to   noncommercial tasks. NASA examined many existing computer systems   each time it needed a machine. In fact, the government's bidding   process gave NASA a larger mix of different vendors' equipment   than most commercial enterprises, causing occasional difficulties   in connecting computers together. This problem and that of   adapting business machines to real-time processing were largely   solved by software. Contractors received invaluable experience in   large systems development and networking in the process of   achieving NASA's goals.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Ground-based computer systems are used for   preflight checkout and the launching of space vehicles,   controlling both unmanned and manned missions, creating   simulations of rocket flight for vehicle development and of space   flight for crew training, processing telemetry data from launch   vehicles and space probes, and in basic research. In the following   chapters these functions are grouped into launch processing,   mission control, and support tasks. Chapter 7 develops the concept   of launch processing from the manual era to the fully automated   Shuttle flight preparation. The chief result from this effort was   a large integrated network of computers that proved to be highly   innovative. Chapter 8 presents computer systems in both the manned   Mission Control Center in Houston and the unmanned control [206]   centers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Goddard Space   Flight Center. In Chapter 9, the uses of computers in simulations   and data reduction are discussed.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part3.html"><IMGSRC="Index.gif" ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch7-1.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P><DL>   <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></DL><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
