In conventional   aircraft, mechanical linkages and cables connect pilot controls,   such as the rudder pedals and stick, to hydraulic actuators at the   control surfaces. However, the Shuttle contains a fully digital   fly-by-wire avionics system. All connections are electrical and   are routed through computers. To give the spacecraft more   autonomy, system management functions (fuel levels, life support,   etc.), handled on the ground during previous flight programs, are   monitored on board. Software can be adjusted to suit increasingly   complex and varied payloads. Subsystems, like the main engines,   that had no computer assistance before use them for performance   improvement. And, as in Gemini and Apollo, guidance and navigation   tasks are accomplished on the Shuttle with computers. All these   functions, especially flight control, are critical to mission   success; therefore, the computers performing the tasks must be   made fail-safe by using redundancy. Meeting these requirements has   resulted in one of the most complex software systems ever produced   and a computer network within the spacecraft with more powerful   hardware than many ground-based computer centers in the   mid-1960s.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The major differences between the Shuttle   computer system and the systems used on Gemini and Apollo were the   choice of an "off-the-shelf" main computer instead of a   custom-made machine and the pervasiveness of the system within the   spacecraft, since the main computers are the heart of any true   avionics system. Avionics (aviation plus electronics) grew in the   1950s and 1960s as electronic devices, especially digital devices,   replaced mechanical or analog equipment in aircraft. These digital   devices were combined into a coherent system, rather than isolated   in function and location within the aircraft. Several modem   military airplanes have applied this concept to varying degrees.   The FB-111, an Air Force tactical bomber, has a complex avionics   system that Rockwell International built just before it was   awarded the Shuttle contract</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">1</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">; the F-15 fighter used an AP-1 computer in its   system.

However, in no aircraft has the Shuttle's avionics   system been matched as yet. For instance, its main computers have   to interconnect with other computers in subsystems, such as the   controllers on each main engine, whereas most aircraft systems are   centered on a single set of machines.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Since the Shuttle is completely dependent   on the success of its avionics system, each component must be made   failure proof. The method chosen to ensure this is absolute   redundancy, often to a depth of four duplicate devices. Managing   this level of redundancy became a large problem in itself.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Another result of the pervasive avionics   system is that the frequency and sophistication of the crew   interaction with the computers exceeds any previous manned space   program.
