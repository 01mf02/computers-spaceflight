The Gemini and Apollo computer   systems were custom-built processors. Apollo did have an immediate   predecessor, but the number of changes necessary before flight   negated most of its resemblance to the Polaris system. To the   contrary, Skylab and, later, the Shuttle, used "off-the-shelf" IBM   4Pi series processors, though they both needed the addition of a   customized I/O system, a simpler and necessarily idiosyncratic   component. By using existing computers, NASA avoided the serious   problems associated with man-rating a new system encountered   during the Apollo program.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The 4Pi descended directly from the System   360 architecture IBM developed in the early 1960s. Some 4Pis were   at work in aircraft by the latter part of that decade. The   top-of-the-line 4Pi is the AP-101, eventually used in the F-15,   B-52, and Shuttle. The version on board Skylab was the TC-l, which   used a 16-bit word, in contrast to the AP-101's 32 bits. A TC-l   processor, an interface controller, an I/O assembly, and a power   supply made up an ATMDC</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">10</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Each flight computer had a memory of 16,384   words</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">11</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This memory was a destructive readout core memory,   which means that the bits were erased as they were read and that   the memory location had to be refreshed with the contents of a   buffer register, which saved a copy of the bits before they were   passed on to the processor. The memory was in two modules of 8K   words each</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">12</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Addressing ranged from 0 to 8K, with a hardware   switch determining which module was being   accessed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">13</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The redundant computer system was composed of two   processors attached to a single Workshop Computer Interface Unit.   The unit consisted of two I/O sections (one for each computer), a   common section, and a power supply</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">14</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Only the I/O section connected to the active   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">69</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   computer was powered. The inactive computer and its I/O section of   the interface unit were not powered. The common section contained   a 64-bit transfer register and timer associated with redundancy   management</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">15</FONT></SUP></B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</A></FONT></SUP><FONT FACE="Geneva"> The transfer   register and timer were the only parts of Skylab that consisted of   triple modular redundant (TMR) circuits</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">16</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Basically, TMR circuits sent signals in triplicate   on separate channels and then voted. The single output from a TMR   voter represented either two or three identical inputs.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The final component of the computer   subsystem was the Memory Load Unit. The original design did not   contain one, but, like the Gemini Auxiliary Tape Memory, engineers   later added it. Whereas the Gemini tape unit was useful in   handling memory overloads, designers included the Skylab tape unit   to further increase the reliability of the system. It carried a   16K software load and an 8K load that could be written into either   module of either memory of the ATDCs. If up to three modules   failed, the mission could continue with reduced capabilities with   an 8K program loaded into the remaining module. This raised the   total reliability of the system from a factor of 0.87 to   0.97</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">17</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

IBM imposed some   manufacturing changes on the recorders (primarily piece part   screening) to make the process more nearly match the care taken in   constructing the computers</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">19</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA awarded the contract for the computer   system to IBM on March 5, 1969</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">20</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. By October, designers froze the choice of   processors and their configuration, a decision heavily influenced   by the concern for redundancy and reliability</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">21</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The first computer was delivered on December 23,   1969. IBM eventually built 10, the final 2 being the flight   versions, which went to NASA on February 11, 1972, over a year   before launch. Two of the ATMDCs and an interface unit were turned   over to IBM for use in testing both hardware and software,   ensuring that the final verification would be on actual equipment   rather than simulators</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source3.html">22</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">IBM took great pride in delivering on time   without sacrificing reliability.

A transmission of software from the   ground to the computer was also practiced.
