The   nonprogrammable version of the Central Computer and Sequencer   would soon make its first flight on Mariner Venus 1962. Even at   that early date, JPL expected to use computers on board the "Grand   Tour" spacecraft planned for the 1970s. A favorable alignment of   the outer planets would make possible a mission that could fly by   Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, thus having encounters with   all the gas giants in one sweep. Such a mission would have to last   for years, with the spacecraft operating autonomously for long   periods of time. Inconvenient speed-of-light communications delays   in the exploration of the inner planets would become crippling in   an outer planets mission, requiring a spacecraft to carry its own   "brain," because the earthbound brains of its makers would be   hours away in an emergency.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Avizienis' chief interest was in computer   reliability. Computer failures occurred much more frequently then   than in today's world of ICs. A computer entrusted with the   successful completion of a deep space mission could not afford to   fail before or during its long awaited encounter, so JPL and   Avizienis' interests came together at just the right time. During   the period from 1961 to 1965, the Laboratory sponsored his search   for a more fault-tolerant computer. In 1965 the reliability scheme   was settled and construction of a prototype began. The breadboard   version first ran a program in March of 1969, after a 2-year   effort at software development</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">38</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Avizienis named the computer STAR, for self   testing and repair, and the name gives a clue to the architecture.   JPL's Flight Computers and Sequencers Section of the Guidance and   Navigation Division paid for the work. Avizienis was responsible   for the concept; David A. Rennels, later a colleague at UCLA, for   the hardware; John A. Rohr, for the software. F.P. Mathur did the   reliability calculations, and the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory   developed the read-only memory, which was basically a core rope   type of memory</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">39</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">150</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] Avizienis used   selective redundancy to achieve reliability. On the Space Shuttle,   the on-board computers are complete redundant versions of each   other and are considered multiple computers. In the STAR, the   computer is considered a single entity with its separate   components replicated. Thus, each subsystem of STAR had several   duplicate versions of itself in the computer as spares. The key   advantage is that the spares were unpowered as long as the primary   component ran successfully. Only when there was a failure would   the spare come to life, and then power to the failed component   would be cut off. Thus, the total power consumption of the STAR   equaled, but did not exceed, that of a similar computer without   the spares, making it attractive to power-conscious spacecraft   designers</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">40</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. In the 1960s, all spacecraft computers were   simplex systems. The only ultrareliable system was the Launch   Vehicle Digital Computer used on the Saturn IB and Saturn V   boosters. Its reliability was achieved by using triple modular   redundant (TMR) circuits such as those in the Common Section of   the Skylab computer system. Avizienis evaluated TMR circuitry and   found that the number of independent failures a TMR system could   tolerate before failing was much smaller than a   component-redundant computer such as STAR could   tolerate</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">41</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Also, reliability theoretically increased through   dormancy</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">42</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) figures for a   component begin when the component is turned on; thus, a subsystem   with a MTBF of 1,000 hours, backed up with two identical spares,   yields a MTBF of 3,000 hours. That was the theory behind   STAR.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Avizienis reasoned that failures were   either caused by transient conditions or permanent component   failures. In order to check for transient faults, STAR would   repeat the program segment in which a fault was first detected. If   the fault repeated itself, the affected component would be turned   off and its spare activated, with the program segment repeated   again. All fault detection was by hardware techniques, with   error-correcting codes included in the software</FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">43</A></FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Potentially, STAR could be an "automatic   repairman" for the entire spacecraft, if other spacecraft systems   used the same concepts</FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">44</A></FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Applications for   STAR</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1969, JPL began designing a   Thermoelectric Outer Planet Spacecraft, or TOPS. In previous inner   planet probes, the flight paths were close enough to the sun to   enable the spacecraft to use solar cells for power generation.   Outer planet missions ranged so far from the sun that solar cells   would be inadequate. TOPS would carry radioisotope thermoelectric   generators to provide electrical power.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   [<A NAME="151"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">151</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT>   </CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p151.htm"><IMG   SRC="p151s.jpg" ALT="Figure 5-3.

Since MIT built the device, the description almost   certainly indicates that it was a core rope similar to that used   in the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). The basic version used two   copies of 4K of random-access memory, with up to 12 units   attachable. Avizienis forsaw that the memory would have to be   reprogrammed in flight on a mission like Grand Tour, so provision   was made for that function</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">47</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Use of a large word size was not to   increase arithmetic power as much as to provide space for   error-checking codes. A STAR address consisted of a 16-bit field   for the address and a 4-bit check field. The address would be   multiplied by 15 (yielding 20 bits), and then stored or   transmitted along the bus during an operation. At the receiving   end, the address would be evaluated according to the following   equation:</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">C(a) = 15-15Ia</FONT></CENTER>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">where 15Ia is the modulo residue of a.   Numeric data were handled similarly; the 28-bit operands   multiplied by 15 to get a 32-bit word. If the result of the check   operation was zero residue, the data or address was correct. If   not, STAR issued a fault signal</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">48</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">STAR had three control signals. One was   the common 1-megahertz CLOCK signal. RESET indicated a return to a   standard initial state. SYNC signaled the beginning of a new   10-step instruction cycle</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">49</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. If a fault was detected, the computer would return   to the last SYNC point and begin executing instructions from   there. If the 10 instructions after the SYNC were executed   successfully, STAR sent a new SYNC signal.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">STAR's read/write memory units were   different in that they would recognize either their hard-wired   name or an assigned name</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">50</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. In this way, if a memory unit and its backup copy   failed, another memory unit could be assigned its name, loaded   with the appropriate data, and then act like the original memory   unit, thus avoiding the necessity of changing all the addresses in   the software. When an instruction appeared on the memory in (MI)   bus, the memory unit that had that address put its contents on the   memory out (MO) bus, and the Arithmetic Processor or other   component loaded it in for processing</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">51</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">153</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] The heart of the   STAR was the Testing and Repair Processor, or TARP. Whereas the   other components of STAR had either one or two unpowered spares,   the TARP had three active versions and two inactive spares.   Functions of the TARP were to maintain the rollback points to   which the software returned after a failure detection, to diagnose   failures, and to check itself. Each time an error check was made,   TARP's three units would vote. If all three or two of three   indicated a failure, then the TARP issued an unconditional   transfer to the rollback point. In the case of a 2-to-1 vote, the   dissenting unit was considered failed, and was shut off as a spare   was activated</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">52</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Another TARP disagreement caused the last spare to   be activated. On the third TARP failure, one of the previously   shut down units would be reactivated, so that there were always   three TARPs in action at any given time. Avizienis thought that   since most failures would be transients, it would be safe to   reactivate a unit. After all, if it disagreed again, it would be   shutdown.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">John A. Rohr's software group did not   begin work until 1967. An assembler, loader, and simulator were   developed on a UNIVAC 1108 mainframe computer owned by   JPL</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">53</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

In this way, some of the tedium associated with   assembly language programming was avoided.

The chief physical obstacle to using STAR on a   spacecraft was size.

Even though progress was made in this area, STAR   never flew on a spacecraft. Components built to STAR   specifications found their way into the NASA Standard Spacecraft   Computer 1 (NSSC-1), used in earth orbital operations, but the   concept of selective redundancy was not incorporated into flight   computers to the extent desired by Avizienis.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">STAR did not find its way to the outer   planets for two reasons.

Even though the Voyagers were launched in the late   1970s, the original TOPS program and the Grand Tour were canceled   due to budget constraints. The fact that Voyager 2 is essentially   executing the Grand Tour is a bonus. On-board computers used on   Voyager developed from a different line. So, even though Avizienis   designed a Super-STAR with a microprogrammable processor using   large-scale integration technology, which seemed certain to   fulfill the requirements of size, power, and weight, he never sold   it to JPL</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">64</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. A second reason STAR never flew was that engineers   were concerned that the STAR's TARP and its failure switches were   a weak point. The concept of a TARP, as with TMR, is always   limited by the question of "who tests the   tester?"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">65</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The actual switches entrusted with powering down a   failed component and charging up another are the weakest link in   the system. At one point, JPL subcontracted to the Stanford   Research Institute for work on a magnetic switch, but apparently   the results were not satisfying</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source5.html">66</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The STAR research program was not a waste   even though the computer itself did not fly.
