Ironically, even though the   production of high-quality images from space probes and Landsat   earth orbiters has great scientific and public relations value,   the concept of digital image processing was not incorporated in   the original planning of a number of early missions. Instead, it   had to gain acceptance as a "tack-on" to the Ranger and Surveyor   programs</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">51</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Robert Nathan led the development of digital image   processing in its early stages, and with the technical help of   other JPL scientists, won for it a featured place on the planetary   missions of the late 1960s and beyond. Of the early resistance, he   later said that he "had to prove to [project management] each time   what they needed" to get the most out of the first American   pictures coming from space.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">288</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;Nathan came   to the California Institute of Technology as a graduate student in   1952. He earned a Ph.D. in crystallography in 1955 and soon found   himself running CalTech's fledgling computer center, where he   received a good grounding in the potential of digital computers.   In 1959, he went to JPL to help develop imaging equipment to map   the moon. When he saw the Russian pictures of the far side of the   moon, he thought he could do better and began developing digital   techniques for image enhancement using a small NCR 102D computer.   Nathan reasoned that analog equipment, such as television cameras,   could only be controlled by hardware changes, just like an analog   computer can only have its internal program changed by rewiring or   switching components. However, digital processing allows changes   to be made with software, allowing a wider variety of   enhancements</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">52</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Before an image can be processed, it must   be put into digital form. Frederick Billingsley and Roger Brandt   of JPL devised a Video Film Converter (VFC) that could transform   analog video signals, such as those sent back by Ranger   spacecraft, into digital data. While they supervised the   construction of the device, John Morecroft of JPL used the NCR   computer to begin programming processing algorithms. These events   took place in 1963, and by the next year Howard Frieden had   programmed the Laboratory's institutional IBM 7094 computer to   process Ranger data. Success with Ranger images led the Surveyor   project to use Nathan's techniques, as well as Mariner Mars 1964.   By the Mariner Mars 1969 missions, the concept of digital image   processing was fully accepted.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Why is image processing needed? Due to the   resolution and design of the video cameras used to make the   images, they must be processed in order to return the most   information possible. The surface of Mars is such a low-contrast   object that without enhancements, features would be lost in the   wash of monocolor</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">53</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Also, because the human eye cannot adjust to   differences in illumination across a field of view, illumination   must be normalized</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">54</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The cameras operate by taking an instantaneous   view of the scene; the values of the light impressed on the   vidicon tube are then made into digital data. Since images are   taken one after the other, very close together in time, residual   images from prior "snapshots" affect the current   view</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">55</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. These residual images must be removed, a technique   that took several missions to perfect. Finally, noise from   transmitting a signal over planetary distances must be accounted   for.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">To see how such processing is done, the   real-time display system used for the Mariner Mars 1971 orbital   mapping mission provides a useful example. A UNIVAC MTC 1230   computer extracted 9-bit pixel data from the telemetry stream. A   pixel is a single picture element, or dot. The spacecraft had a   camera capable of recording frames of 700 lines by 832 pixels, or   580,000 individual dots. Such large [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">289</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;numbers of   pixels were only practical as interplanetary communication   advanced. Mariner Mars 1964's 200 by 200 pixel imaging equipment   transmitted at the rate of 8 1/3rd bits per second. Thus, it took   nearly one entire shift at a Deep Space Network station to record   a single frame. At that data rate it would take over 1 week for a   Mariner Mars 1971 frame! But by 1971, the data rate increased to   16,200 bits per second, giving a complete picture in 5 minutes and   40 seconds. Even these rates increased by over seven times in the   next few years.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   </FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p289.jpg" WIDTH=576   HEIGHT=546 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight   ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Figure 9-7A.

Contrast   stretching helped increase the contrast of the single color   Martian surface. Original values of the pixels ranged from 0   (black) to 255 (white). The computer truncated these to 6 bits,   which yielded 64 levels. Since humans can only discern about 25   levels of grayness, this was more than enough. By increasing the   brighter grays toward the white end of the scale and decreasing   the darker grays toward the black end, the contrast was   increased</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">56</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Illumination could also be normalized using the   computers. A "high pass filter" corrected the value of the pixels   by averaging the immediately surrounding 125 pixels and then   subtracting the running average from the value of the   pixel</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">57</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Another process compensated for geometric   distortion. Simply because of the way the cameras were made, there   was distortion in the image frames. Reference points marked on the   image served to help distortion elimination algorithms properly   square off the image. These techniques were also applicable to   developing mosaic maps by taking images shot at oblique angles and   flattening them out in any one of several   projections</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">58</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Noise elimination could be done by assuming that   any pixel exceeding a difference of 32 levels of brightness from   its neighbors was a spike and then changing the value of the spike   to the average of its two immediate neighbors. From 20 to 10,000   spikes could be found on a single raw image, so without removal   the image would be noticeably damaged</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">59</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aside from the near-real-time imaging   provided by the UNIVAC and other computers on later missions,   long-term processing with a number of techniques is done in the   Image Processing Laboratory at JPL. First established in 1965 with   a new IBM 360/44 computer that lasted 10 years, the Processing Lab   pioneered new imaging techniques and developed support software to   implement them. Central to the success of image processing was the   Video Information Communication and Retrieval language, or VICAR.   Written in 1966 after a design by Stan Bressler and Howard   Frieden, VICAR enabled users to define a pipeline of processes   without having to use cumbersome job control language. For   instance, VICAR could define an image file to be processed and   then specify the type of processing to be performed on it in a   sequential manner. Output from the stretching program could thus   be directed to the input to the geometric transformation program.   The existence of this language significantly increased the value   of the imaging</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">60</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">By 1975, when a 360/65 replaced the older   computer, the Image Lab did roughly half of its work on planetary   imaging and half on earth resources work using Landsat   images</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">61</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Robert   Selzer of JPL had applied the techniques to x-ray enhancement. For   Nathan, with a background in x-ray crystallography, this was a   natural step. Unfortunately, by 1973 the government canceled all   fundamental research grants in the field and Nathan found himself   without support and nearly without a JPL   position</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">62</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></P>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Nathan managed to hold on for a few more   years at JPL on other projects until, in the late 1970s, he   thought of a way to increase the speed of the then   computer-time-hungry image-processing programs. With Mariner Mars   1971 it became possible to send images faster than they could be   processed. Since then, the ratio between transmission time and   processing time has gone way up in favor of transmit time. In   general, it does not really matter, since instant images are not   now a requirement, but for users of image processing other than   planetary scientists, additional speed is attractive. Also, as the   number of images has skyrocketed from Mariner Mars 1964's 22 to   literally tens of thousands in the Voyager and Galileo projects,   time to process the images is of interest even to the most   patient. The problem is that as the number of pixels has   increased, the number of individual computations also increases. A   1,000 by 1,000 pixel image weighted 35 by 35 times requires 1.225   billion multiplications</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">63</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">! If these are done in sequence, the amount of   processing time would be formidable.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">To solve this problem, Nathan suggested   putting 35 sets of 35 multipliers in parallel on very large-scale   integration (VLSI) chips. By doing that, the amount of   calculations is reduced by 1,225 to 1. Recently, he has begun   design of a set of VLSI chips that will speed up the geometry or   reprojection operations</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source9.html">64</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Basically, the weighting algorithm is encapsulated   in a single chip as a unit of hardware, rather than as software.   Logic in hardware executes faster than logic in software because   all 1,225 multipliers are operating simultaneously in parallel   rather than one at a time serially as in a central processor.   Nathan's chips have been plugged into Digital Equipment   Corporation VAX 11/780 computers. When the computer is executing   an image-processing program and reaches the point where it wants   to do the algorithm on the chip, the computer "calls" the chip   just as though it were calling a software subroutine.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   </FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">295</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT>   </CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p295.jpg" WIDTH=541   HEIGHT=689 X-SAS-UseImageWidth X-SAS-UseImageHeight   ALIGN=bottom></FONT></CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">Figure 9-9A.
