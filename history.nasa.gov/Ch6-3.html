Galileo will   proceed toward Jupiter, launching a probe 5 months before arrival.   Plans are for the probe to enter the Jovian atmosphere at a   relatively low angle, using an aeroshell braking system for entry   followed by a parachute system for final braking and descent. Due   to the nature of the entry, an antenna large enough to send data   directly to earth cannot be carried on the probe. Instead, it has   to relay the data to the orbiter, which will fly a parallel path   thousands of kilometers above. At the end of the probe mission,   expected to last 60 to 75 minutes until the probe is crushed by   atmospheric pressure, the orbiter will execute an insertion burn.   For the next 2 years, the orbiter will fly by the four Galilean   satellites (hence, the mission name), using gravity assists to   change its path after each encounter.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Great demands will be placed on Galileo's   on-board computer systems, because of both the nature of the   mission and the design of the spacecraft itself.

Budget constraints forced NASA to buy just one   Galileo, so there was tremendous pressure to construct a highly   reliable spacecraft. Additional pressure has been on the project   because of changes in the launch date and booster rocket.   Originally scheduled for a 1982 launch, delays in the Shuttle   program and other factors caused rescheduling to 1984, then 1985   and, finally, 1986, when the grounding of the Shuttle fleet forced   an indefinite postponement. At first, the Air Force's Inertial   Upper Stage rocket was chosen for the booster. Later, the new   "wide body" Centaur got the job. Centaur upper stages have flown   on Atlas and Titan III boosters since the 1960s. The new "fat   Centaur" would carry 50% more fuel than the earlier version. Other   changes were made to adapt it to the Shuttle cargo bay. One JPL   engineer said that it is "like Abe Lincoln's axe. The head broke   and they replaced it and the handle broke and they put on a new   one, but it's still Abe Lincoln's axe"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">77</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. However, NASA canceled the Shuttle version of the   new Centaur in the spring of 1986 due to safety considerations,   leaving Galileo without a ride to Jupiter. [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">188</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;By early   1987, NASA decided to go back to using the Inertial Upper Stage,   but it has significantly lower lifting capability than the   Centaur. As a result, the flight path has to be changed to include   a Venus flyby and two Earth flybys to gain velocity by gravity   assistance. Unfortunately, the total flight time to Jupiter will   nearly triple to about seven years.</FONT></P>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Spacecraft design also caused problems for   the computer designers. All previous JPL probes have been   three-axis inertial to gain advantages such as easing   communication and providing a stable scan platform for imaging.   Galileo has a fixed attitude area, called the "despun section,"   and also a "spun section" that rotates three times a minute.   Fields and particles experimenters required a spin to help them   differentiate local fields from external fields. Aside from the   obvious increase in the order of magnitude of the attitude control   problem on a dual-spin spacecraft, communication between the two   parts is hampered by the need to transmit serially across a rotary   transformer. Four hundred milliseconds are required to send a   message between the spun and despun sections</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">78</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. To overcome this time penalty and provide more   real-time control, a fully distributed system of computers is   mandated.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   </FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><IMG SRC="p188.jpg"   ALT="FIGURE 6-4.

Eight of the nine instruments have   microprocessors for control and data handling</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">79</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. These have to communicate with the Command and   Data System, itself containing six microprocessors. Attitude and   Articulation Control has dual computers, and the probe also   contains a dual microprocessor system. In all, Galileo contains 19   microprocessors with about 320K of semiconductor random access   memory and 41K of read-only memory</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">80</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Procurement of the systems for   the Command and Data handling equipment and the attitude control   equipment proceeded separately but in a somewhat coordinated   fashion. In the case of the Command system, a 1977 study examined   using the existing Voyager computers, the National Standard   Spacecraft Computer (NSSC-1), and some form of a microprocessor   distributed system like the Unified Data System (UDS), then a   research program at JPL aimed at complex long-duration space   missions</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">81</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Although a lot of pressure was exerted on   Galileo's builders to choose either the existing equipment or the   NSSC-1, cost factors favored the UDS as the basis for the Command   and Data Subsystem</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">82</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Similarly, the attitude control group was   pressured to use the NSSC-1, but the desire for floating point and   greater power defeated that idea. Since the star tracker is in the   spun section and thus moving, complex coordinate transformations   must be calculated, and the NSSC-1 was not up to   it</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">83</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">With new computers needed for both major   controlling subsystems, JPL carefully explored memory requirements   and software development prospects.

Ideas for the content of the programs came from   Voyager experience and the executive written for the NSSC-1. The   project office originally specified that HAL would be used for   programming all flight software. When irreducible inefficiencies   appeared in the compiler bought for the command and data   computers, HAL was abandoned for that system and replaced with   "structured macros"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">85</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. HAL was retained for the other computer system.   Although most microprocessors in the scientific experiments are   coded in assembler, one is programmed in FORTH, so high-level   languages finally appeared on unmanned spacecraft. The project   office set a limit of 75% memory usage at launch (later raised to   85% for the attitude control computer only) and 85% load at   Jupiter insertion. Officials hoped to avoid the tight memory   problems associated with earlier missions and even asked the   Shuttle software office for advice in setting these   limits</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">86</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">190</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;JPL   considered software crucial to the success of the overall Galileo   mission. As of 1985, Neil Ausman of JPL was in charge of all   software, both flight and ground support, and he reported directly   to project manager John Casani. Patricia Molko, also of the   project office, wrote a standards document for software   development. At one point, Howard W. Tindall, first introduced in   the chapter on the Apollo computer systems, was brought in to   serve as a consultant. He found that in some ways JPL was "going   through the same problems that we did when we developed our   original large programs"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">87</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Three buses were also present, each controlled by a HLM.   Functionally there was one HLM dedicated to stored sequence   control, one for real-time control, and the third as a spare. LLMs   in that configuration handled sequencing, telemetry. Status   polling, and other subfunctions.

Whereas reconfiguration after a   failure was done by combining any of the remaining processors into   a new control string in the UDS, on Galileo two basically   identical strings are configured from the start, one backing up   the other much like the backup processors on Viking and Voyager.   Each HLM has 32K of memory and a bus controller associated with   it. A LLM with a processor and 16K of memory for engineering   control is connected to the string, along with a data bulk memory   (DBUM) of 8K and a bulk memory (BUM) of 16K.

They are a self test, a clock, and bus   control. Background processes begin each 2/3 second, and are much   more complex. Functions done in the background have been divided   into six virtual machines," a term of many meanings. In this case,   three virtual machines are considered "privileged": the   administration machine, the contingency action program machine,   and the fault processing machine. These three machines consist of   software that is always resident in the Galileo computers and is   kept in the 12K of write-protected memory</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">116.</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> They are called privileged because the   nonprivileged machines can be canceled if they do not complete   processing before the end of the 2/3-second cycle, whereas the   privileged machines can never be canceled. Nonprivileged machines   include an immediate action program machine, a delayed action   program machine, and a stored sequence program machine. So the   nonprivileged machines are reserved for commands and sequence   control, whereas the privileged machines are for executive and   fault detection and correction. Nonprivileged software is to be   updated about once a week in flight</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">117</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Software developers imagine that a "wall" exists   between the privileged and nonprivileged machines. They consider   that the nonprivileged software is more error prone because it is   constantly changing, whereas the privileged software should have   had a thorough exercise over several years in testing before the   flight.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Execution of the virtual machine software   is related to the 2/3-second interrupt. In each cycle the software   goes through each virtual machine pending program stack and   executes what is waiting. Many programs can be running in each   virtual machine in each cycle, up to 10 in the administration and   fault protection machines, for example. As mentioned above, the   privileged machines always get to clear their pending programs,   whereas the nonprivileged machines do what they can until the time   is up.</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DD><FONT FACE="Geneva">Software described so far is resident in   the HLMs. LLMs have specialized software for their particular   functions, such as monitoring engineering instrumentation and   talking to the launch vehicle.

RCA 1802s used in the Command and Data Subsystem   were actually much less sensitive, being of older, and thus less   dense, technology.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Attitude control engineer Kopf commented,   "It is not worth flying the mission if you cannot get rid of the   SEU problem." Failures were most likely at the most critical part   of the probe mission when the orbiter is very near Jupiter. In   order to avoid possible further delays in an already much   postponed mission, Lee searched for solutions along two tracks.   One solution would use a radiation-hardened processor built by   Trecor called the RHEC-Rad Hardened Emulating Computer-1750A. Even   though it is an emulator capable of imitating the 2901, a new   retargeted HAL compiler would be needed. The cost of this solution   would be $20 million. Lee's second solution was to contract with   Sandia National Laboratories to custom make radiation-hardened   2901s. No software needed be changed, just new ICs were necessary,   and they cost $5 million. Due to cost considerations and the   inherent attraction of retaining the already created and largely   validated software, the Sandia solution was   chosen</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">146</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. As a footnote, [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">203</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;it is   interesting that if the Galileo had launched on time, a sufficient   understanding of the SEU problem would not yet have been   available, and a doomed spacecraft carrying an unknown time bomb   would have been traveling toward an unfriendly Jupiter waiting to   hurl ion thunderbolts at it.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch6-2.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch6-4.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
