Even though the software was admittedly the key component   of the spacecraft, NASA chose the hardware before the first   software requirement was written. This is typical of practice in   1972, but less so now. NASA managers knew that time and money   spent on detailed software requirements specification and the   corresponding development of a test and verification program would   save millions of dollars and much effort later. The establishment   of a dedicated facility for development was an innovative idea and   helped keep costs down by centralization and standardization. A   combination of complete requirements, an aggressive test plan, a   decent development facility, and the experience of NASA, Rockwell,   Draper, and IBM engineers in real-time systems was enough to   create a successful Shuttle DPS.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Even as the system took shape, NASA   managers looked to the future of manned spacecraft software.   Increased automation of code and test case generation, automated   change insertion and verification, and perhaps automated   requirements development are all considered future necessities if   development costs are to be kept down and reliability increased.   In the 1980s, a new opportunity for software development and   hardware selection presents itself with NASA's long-awaited Space   Station. NASA has another chance to adopt updated software   engineering techniques and, perhaps, to develop others. Success in   space is increasingly tied to success in the software   factory.</FONT></DL><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><HR></FONT></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch4-8.html"><IMGSRC="Previous.gif" ALT="link to previous page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40BORDER=2 ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONTFACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part1.html"><IMG SRC="Index.gif"ALT="link to index" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Part2.html"><IMGSRC="Next.gif" ALT="link to next page" WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=2ALIGN=bottom></A></FONT></CENTER></P></BODY></HTML>
