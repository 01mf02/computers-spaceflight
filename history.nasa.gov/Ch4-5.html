Even though NASA   engineers estimated the size of the flight software to be smaller   than that on Apollo, the ubiquitous functions of the Shuttle   computers meant that no one group of engineers and no one company   could do the software on its own. This increased the size of the   task because of the communication necessary between the working   groups. It also increased the complexity of a spacecraft already   made complex by flight requirements and redundancy. Besides these   realities, no one could foresee the final form that the software   for this pioneering vehicle would take, even after years of   development work had elapsed, since there continued to be both   minor and major changes. NASA and its contractors made over 2,000   requirements changes between 1975 and the first flight in   1981</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">80</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. As a result, about $200 million was spent on   software, as opposed to an initial estimate of $20 million. Even   so, NASA lessened the difficulties by making several early   decisions that were crucial for the program's success. NASA   separated the software contract from the hardware contract,   closely managed the contractors and their methods, chose a   high-level language, and maintained conceptual integrity.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA awarded IBM Corporation the first   independent Shuttle software contract on March 10, 1973. IBM and   Rockwell International had worked together during the period of   competition for the orbiter contract</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">81</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Rockwell bid on the entire aerospacecraft,   intending to subcontract the computer hardware and software to   IBM. But to Rockwell's dismay, NASA decided to separate the   software contract from the orbiter contract. As a result, Rockwell   still subcontracted with IBM for the computers, but IBM hand a   separate software contract monitored closely by the Spacecraft   Software Division of the Johnson Space Center. There are several   reasons why this division of labor occurred. Since software does   not weigh anything in and of itself, it is used to overcome   hardware problems that would require extra systems and components   (such as a mechanical control system)</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">82</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Thus software is in many ways the most critical   component of the Shuttle, as it ties the other components   together. Its importance to the overall program alone justified a   separate contract, since it made the contractor directly   accountable to NASA. Moreover, during the operations phase,   software underwent the most changes, the hardware being   essentially fixed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">83</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. As time went on, Rockwell's responsibilities as   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">109</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   prime hardware contractor were phased out, and the shuttles were   turned over to an operations group. In late 1983, Lockheed   Corporation, not Rockwell, won the competition for the operations   contract. By keeping the software contract separate, NASA could   develop the code on a continuing basis. There is a considerable   difference between changing maintenance mechanics on an existing   hardware system and changing software companies on a not yet   perfect system because to date the relationships between   components in software are much harder to define than those in   hardware. Personnel experienced with a specific software system   are the best people to maintain it. Lastly, Christopher Kraft of   Johnson Space Center and George Low of NASA Headquarters, both   highly influential in the manned spacecraft program during the   early 1970's, felt that Johnson had the software management   expertise to handle the contract directly</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">84</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">One of the lessons learned from monitoring   Draper Laboratory in the Apollo era was that by having the   software development at a remote site (like Cambridge), the   synergism of informally exchanged ideas is lost; sometimes it took   3 to 4 weeks for new concepts to filter over</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">85</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. IBM had a building and several hundred personnel   near Johnson because of its Mission Control Center contracts. When   IBM won the Shuttle contract, it simply increased its local   force.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The closeness of IBM to Johnson Space   Center also facilitated the ability of NASA to manage the project.   The first chief of the Shuttle's software, Richard Parten,   observed that the experience of NASA managers made a significant   contribution to the success of the programming   effort</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">86</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Although IBM was a giant in the data processing   industry, a pioneer in real time systems, and capable of putting   very bright people on a project, the company had little direct   experience with avionics software. As a consequence, Rockwell had   to supply a lot of information relating to flight control.   Conversely, even though Rockwell projects used computers, software   development on the scale needed for the Shuttle was outside its   experience. NASA Shuttle managers provided the initial   requirements for the software and facilitated the exchange of   information between the principal contractors. This situation was   similar to that during the 1960s when NASA had the best rendezvous   calculations people in the world and had to contribute that   expertise to IBM during the Gemini software development.   Furthermore, the lessons of Apollo inspired the NASA managers to   push IBM for quality at every point</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">87</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The choice of a high level language for   doing the majority of the coding was important because, as Parten   noted, with all the changes, "we'd still be trying to get the   thing off the ground if we'd used assembly   language"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">88</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

On the other hand, if few do the requirements but   many can alter them later, then chaos would reign again.

John R. Garman prepared the Level   A document, which is comprised of a comprehensive description of   the operating system, applications programs, keyboards, displays,   and other components of the software system and its interfaces.   William Sullivan wrote the guidance, navigation and control   requirements, and John Aaron, the system management and payload   specifications of Level B. They were assisted by James Broadfoot   and Robert Ernull</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">93</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

It seems ironic that Draper was instructing NASA   and IBM on such things considering its difficulties in the   mid-1960s with the development of the Apollo flight software. It   was likely those difficult experiences that helped motivate the   MIT engineers to seriously study software techniques and to   become, within a very short time, one of the leading centers of   software engineering theory. The Draper tutorial included the   concept of highly modular software, software that could be   "plugged into" the main circuits of the Shuttle. This concept, an   application of the idea of interchangeable parts to software, is   used in many software systems today, one example being the   UNIX</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch4-5.html#4-5a">***</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> operating system developed at Bell Laboratories in   the 1970s, under which single function software tools can be   combined to perform a large variety of functions.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Draper's second contribution was the   actual writing of some early Level C requirements as a   model</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">98</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This version of the Level C documents contained   the same components as in the later versions delivered by Rockwell   to IBM for coding. Rockwell's editions, however, were much more   detailed and complete, reflecting their practical, rather than   theoretical purpose and have been an irritation for IBM. IBM and   NASA managers suspect that Rockwell, miffed when the software   contract was taken away from them, may have delivered incredibly   precise and detailed specifications to the software contractor.   These include descriptions of flight events for each major portion   of the software, a structure chart of tasks to be done by the   software during that major segment, a functional data flowchart,   and, for each module, its name, calculations, and operations to be   performed, and input and output lists of parameters, the latter   already named and accompanied by a short definition, source,   precision, and what units each are in. This is why one NASA   manager said that "you can't see the forest for the trees" in   Level C, oriented as it is to the production of individual   modules</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">99</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

He further claimed that the early portion of the   Shuttle development was "underengineered" and that Rockwell and   Draper included some requirements that were not passed on by NASA.   Parten, though, said that all requirements documents were subject   to regular review by joint teams from NASA and   Rockwell</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">101</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The impression one gains from documents   and interviews is that both Rockwell and IBM fell victim to the   "not invented here" [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">112</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] syndrome: If we   didn't do it, it wasn't done right. For example, Rockwell   delivered the ascent requirements, and IBM coded them to the   letter, thereby exceeding the available memory by two and a third   times and demonstrating that the requirements for ascent were   excessive. Rockwell, in return, argued for 2 years about the   nature of the operating system, calling for a strict time-sliced   system, which allocates predefined periods of time for the   execution of each task and then suspends tasks unfinished in that   time period and moves on to the next one. The system thus cycles   through all scheduled tasks in a fixed period of time, working on   each in turn.

PASS is divided into two parts: system software and   applications software. The system software is the Flight Computer   Operating System (FCOS), the user interface programming, and the   system control programs, whereas the applications software is   divided into guidance, navigation and control, orbiter systems   management, payload and checkout programs.

The requirements state that these major functions be   called OPS, or operational sequences. (e.g., OPS-1 is ascent;   OPS-3, descent.) Within the OPS are major modes. In OPS-1, the   first-stage burn, second-stage burn, first orbital insertion burn,   second orbital insertion burn, and the initial on-orbit coast are   major modes; transition between major modes is automatic. Since   the total mission software exceeds the capacity of the memory, OPS   transitions are normally initiated by the crew and require the OPS   to be loaded from the MMU. This caused considerable management   concern over the preservation of data, such as the state vector,   needed in more than one OPS</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">105</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

These are   available to the crew as a supplement to the functions being   performed by the current OPS. For example, the descent software   incorporates a SPEC display showing the horizontal situation as a   supplement to the OPS display showing the vertical situation. This   SPEC is obviously not available in the on-orbit OPS. A DISP for   the on-orbit OPS may show fuel cell output levels, fuel reserves   in the orbital maneuvering system, and other such information.   SPECs usually contain items that can be selected by the crew for   execution. DISPs are just what their name means, displays and not   action items. Since SPECs and DISPs have lower priority than OPS,   when a big OPS is in memory they have to be kept on the tape and   rolled in when requested</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">106</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

NASA, Rockwell, and IBM solved most of the   grand conceptual problems, such as the nature of the operating   system and the redundancy management scheme, by 1975.

The minor cycle is the high-frequency cycle; tasks within   it are scheduled every 40 milliseconds. Typical tasks in this   cycle are those related to active flight control in the   atmosphere.

To do this work, NASA established a Software   Development Laboratory at Johnson Space Center in 1972 to prepare   for the implementation of the Shuttle programs and to make the   software tools needed for efficient coding and maintenance. The   Laboratory evolved into the Software Production Facility (SPF) in   which the software development is carried on in the operations   era.

The memo summarized a study of software   requirements for Air Force space missions during the decade of the   1970s.

Most modules developed for [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">117</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] the Shuttle,   such as the general flight control software and memory displays,   would be unclassified. However, Department of Defense (DoD)   payloads require system management and payload management   software, plus occasional special maneuvering modules. These were   expected to be classified. Also, if the software maintenance   contract moved from the original prime contractor to some   different operations contractor, it would be considerably simpler   to accomplish the transfer if the software library and development   computers were government owned and on government property.   Lastly, having such close control over existing software and new   development would eliminate some of the problems in communication,   verification, and maintenance encountered in the three previous   manned programs.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Developing the SPF turned out to be as   large a task as developing the flight software itself.

The ultimate purpose of the facility is to provide   a programming team with sufficient tools to prepare a software   load for a flight. This software load is what is put on to the MMU   tape that is flown on the spacecraft. In the operations era of the   1980s, over 1,000 compiled modules are available. These are fully   tested, and often previously used, versions of tasks such as main   engine throttling, memory modification, and screen displays that   rarely change from flight to flight. New, mission-specific modules   for payloads or rendezvous maneuvers are developed and tested   using the SPF's programming tools, which themselves represent more   than a million lines of code</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source4.html">123</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The selection of existing modules and the new   modules are then combined into a flight load that is subject to   further testing.

Only a new project can do   that. Therefore, the challenge facing NASA is to automate the SPF,   use more existing modules, and free people to work on other tasks.   Unfortunately, the Shuttle software still has bugs, some of which   are no fault of the flight software developers, but rather because   all the tools used in the SPF are not yet mature. One example is   the compiler for HAL/S. Just days before the STS-7 flight, in   June, 1983, an IBM employee discovered that the latest release of   the compiler had a bug in it. A quick check revealed that over 200   flight modules had been modified and recompiled using it. All of   those had to be checked for errors before the flight could go.   Such problems will continue until the basic flight modules and   development tools are no longer constantly subject to change.

Using tools available in   the SPF, the verification teams can use the real flight computers   for their tests (the preferred method).
