Most important of the differences is the long   duration of many unmanned flights. Except for Skylab, no American   manned flight has lasted more than 2 weeks. In contrast, when   Voyager 2 encounters Neptune in 1989, it will have flown for 12   years. During that time, the Voyager Project staff must monitor   the health of the spacecraft and gather and interpret the data it   is collecting. Few of the original engineers will still be   associated with the mission, so conceptually mission planning for   a long-duration unmanned flight must concentrate on an extended   view of operations and the development of detailed   documentation</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">69</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Another difference is that the manned mission   control centers are used for one project at a time, whereas the   unmanned centers may be controlling a wide variety of missions. So   far, there has been no overlap in the manned programs in the sense   that no Mercury flights continued after Gemini flew, and so on. In   contrast, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) commanded Surveyors,   Lunar Orbiters, Pioneers, and Mariners all at once in the   mid-1960s, and has continuously been responsible for multiple   missions.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">Control of Near-Earth Missions   at the Goddard Space Flight Center</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA formed Goddard Space Flight Center   with the Naval Research Laboratory's Vanguard Project team as a   nucleus. After Vanguard ended, use of the IBM 704 in downtown   Washington ceased, and a model 709 was installed at Goddard on May   23, 1960, as a replacement machine for use in working with   earth-orbiting satellites. Within 2 months, the first of six 7090   computers also arrived. Folklore has it that Goddard soon housed   1% of the total computing power in the entire United States.   Although two of the 7090s and later [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">259</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] other computers   supported Mercury flights, Goddard's most substantial customer   base has been the plethora of scientific, navigational,   communications, mapping, and weather satellites launched in the   last quarter of a century.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Goddard pioneered the use of dedicated   small computers for specific missions, thus eliminating the   complexity of handling multiple missions on a single mainframe.   This occurred in spite of the presence of large numbers of big   computers. Some command and control and definitely navigation   calculations are carried out on large machines, but each project   has a small computer to handle data reduction and the day-to-day   operation of the spacecraft. As examples, the Nimbus weather   satellite program used Control Data 160A computers, the Orbiting   Geophysical Observatory had Scientific Data Systems SDS 910 and   920 computers, and so did the Orbiting Solar   Observatory</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">70</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. These machines could be sent on to another project   when their current job ended, and in fact some of the SDS machines   had rather long lifetimes of nearly two decades. In addition to   using small computers at the control center, Goddard installed   UNIVAC 1218 computers in the Manned Spaceflight Network ground   stations, originally for control of Gemini and Agena and later for   Apollo. Both the 160As and 9105 were among the first products of   their respective fledgling companies, and, with the 1218 and   Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP series, the forerunners of the   minicomputer boom of the 1970s.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Relatively little changed in the general   techniques of mission control at Goddard for about two decades. As   the 1980s continue, the trend is for the majority of unmanned   satellites to be commercial rather than scientific in nature.   Commercial satellites are controlled by their owners, although   NASA provides orbit determination and some command services on a   reimbursible basis. However, sufficient missions exist, such as   the expected 17-year duration Hubble Space Telescope, to keep   Goddard involved in ground control activities for some time, along   with its continued commitment to NASCOM and STADAN.</FONT>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></B>      <DT><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">To the Sky's Limit: Mission   Control at JPL</FONT></B></CENTER>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">As Goddard strove to standardize earth   orbital operations and distribute its functions, JPL approached   the similar problems in a different way, centralizing operations   as much as possible. In many respects, Goddard and JPL are   fraternal twins. Each has a set of ground-tracking stations, plus   on-site control centers for a variety of missions. The difference   is that JPL is responsible for deep space exploration. In fact,   the lower limit of its responsibilities is set at 10,000 miles.   For a short period, it did satellite work. JPL developed the   [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">260</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]   guidance system and propulsion for the Sergeant battlefield   missile and studied adapting clusters of the motors as upper   stages to the Redstone missile. The resulting Jupiter-C launch   vehicle put America's first satellite into orbit on the night of   January 31, 1958. Called Explorer I, the satellite carried   JPL-developed instrumentation. A room near the office of   laboratory director Dr. William Pickering became an active   unmanned mission control center since it contained communications   equipment connected to the tracking network that confirmed   Explorer reached orbit. That same year NASA was formed and JPL   became closely affiliated, changing its mission to deep space   work.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1959, the early Pioneer flights aimed   at the moon.

Unlike earth orbiters, whose closeness to the   planet make it necessary to have a large number of stations to   stay in contact, deep space probes needed only three stations   spaced so that one would always face the spacecraft. Initially,   the stations were located in Australia and South Africa as well as   at Goldstone, but later one in Madrid replaced the African station   and the Australian one moved from Woomera to   Canberra</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">72</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Accordingly, Rechtin directed   that the machines be ordered and got the first 920 built and the   second 910. The 910s and 920s still functioned in similar tasks as   late as 1985!</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch8-3.html#8-3a">**</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> </FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Functionally, the SDS computers took data   received from the spacecraft and formatted and recorded it on   magnetic tape.

Dual 7090 computers   similar to those installed at Goddard were bought for data   reduction. To provide flight controllers with more up- to-date   information about spacecraft telemetry, a Digital Equipment   Corporation PDP-1 computer served as a near-real-time data   processor.

Lunar   Orbiters would look for Apollo landing sites and Pioneers were   aimed at deeper space. JPL did not have primary responsibility for   all of these programs. Lunar Orbiter came from Langley Space   Flight Center, and Pioneer from the Ames Research Center. If each   responsible organization had to set up a control center for its   spacecraft, considerable overlap and duplication would occur.   Accordingly, in 1963, NASA decided to have JPL track and command   all deep space missions, with the help of project personnel from   home centers stationed at JPL</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">79</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

Beginning in 1964, two strings   of solid-state computers formed the basis of the system. Each   consisted of an IBM 7094 mainframe, an IBM 7040 medium-sized   computer, and an IBM 1301 disk storage system placed between them.   Later, a trio of System 360/75 computers replaced this   configuration. More recently, the control center adopted a   distributed computing strategy similar to Goddard's.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">263</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] As in the manned   programs, during critical mission phases both strings of the   original generation of equipment would be running at the same time   but with the data from the stations only routed to one of them. If   a 7094 failed, its associated 7040 could be connected to the other   1301 (and, thus, the second 7094), leaving the second 7040 as   another layer of backup</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">86</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Later upgraded to a 7044, the smaller computer   acted as a traffic cop on the incoming data. All inputs (teletype,   telephone, microwave) went to the machine before they went   anywhere else, and the software in the 7040 routed the data to   active programs, inactive programs, or administration   stations</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">87</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. George Gianopolis of JPL, one of those charged   with the responsibility of getting the system to work, remembers   that the 7040s were especially difficult to   install</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">88</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The 7040s deposited data on the 1301 disk storage   system. A 54-megabyte hard disk, the 1301 served both the 7040 and   the 7094 from the middle, so both could access data at identical   addresses. This concept presages the network file servers in the   modern office and the Common Data Buffer in the Launch Processing   System. Airline reservation systems and other large data base   operations utilized the same configuration beginning at about the   same time. Using a smaller computer to handle resource-hungry   input and output tasks and a common storage area is a standard   network concept today. As for the 7094, the flight operations   director could control its use by "percentage time sharing" in   which higher priority jobs simply got more machine   time</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">89</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. The primary functions of the 7094 were telemetry   analysis, tracking, predictive work for the stations, and maneuver   commanding.

By the time Voyager neared Jupiter, two strings of   dedicated minicomputers performed the telemetry, tracking, and   engineering monitoring functions. A single minicomputer shared by   several projects did the commanding. Why did the change occur?   First, the Deep Space Network was unhappy with the level of   support it derived from a centralized system. Second, even though   centralizing deep space mission control at JPL was a sound idea,   putting too many missions on a single computer system was less so.   No matter how much JPL tried to standardize things, each mission   had its unique characteristics, calling for changes in the support   software. With a distributed system, changes could be made without   affecting other software. When missions neared critical phases,   such as launch or encounter, software had to be frozen until the   phase passed. With enough spacecraft aloft, the amount of time   available to change software became quite   short</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">104</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">NASA provided an additional impetus to   switch to a distributed system. Acknowledging the Deep Space   Network's concern over using the 360s in the JPL control center   and worried that the Network could not monitor its performance   when supporting projects originating at other centers (such as   Pioneer), the Agency directed the Network to develop monitoring   capability in separate computers. Between 1972 and 1974, a set of   ModComp 2 minicomputers was connected in a local area network at   JPL to implement this directive</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source8.html">105</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">In 1976, the control center itself   converted from 360s to ModComp 2s and 4s in preparation for   Voyager.

These computers are arranged in redundant sets.   Each project (Voyager, Galileo, etc.) has its own telemetry   machine and shares a command machine. A routing computer in the   basement of the Space Flight Operations Facility building is the   entry point of all data from NASCOM, sending the data to the   appropriate computer. The command computer reverses the process   for outgoing data.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;   <HR SIZE="1" WIDTH="75%" NOSHADE>   [<A NAME="266"></A></FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">266</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">] </FONT>   </CENTER>      <DD><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>      <DT><CENTER><FONT FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="p266.htm"><IMG   SRC="p266s.jpg" ALT="Figure 8-4.
