Although TOPS'   original mission was to conduct the Grand Tour of the four gas   giant planets, Voyager was limited to flybys of the innermost two,   Jupiter and Saturn. However, favorable gravity assists and   hardware longevity made it possible to plan for a Uranus flyby by   the Voyager 2 spacecraft and, potentially, a Neptune encounter.   After visiting Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 1 is to travel out of   the plane of the planetary orbits and leave the solar   system.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Voyager employs three dual-redundant   computer systems per spacecraft.

Telemetry data formatting and   transmission handled by the Flight Data System are done on Voyager   with the help of a custom-built computer. Attitude control and   articulation of the scan platform are accomplished with the third   computer system. One concept from the STAR computer proposed for   the TOPS, applicable to Voyager, is dormancy.

Although both CCSs are always powered, rarely are   both Flight Data Systems running, and both attitude control   computers are never turned on at the same time. Full bit-for-bit   redundancy is not maintained in the dual memories. For example,   "expended" algorithms, such as the deployment sequence executed   shortly after separation from the booster, need not be   maintained</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">5</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Both memories are accessed by the single active   processor in each system. The Flight Data System keeps a copy of   its instructions in both memories, but intermediate data and   variables can be stored in either memory.

Whereas   Viking was assigned a single Cognizant Software Engineer, Voyager   had three, managed by a Spacecraft Software Engineer. H. Kent   Frewing of JPL assumed this position in early 1974 and sent out a   series of organizing memos during the first half of that   year.</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Ch6-2.html#6-2a">**</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> Frewing's February 20, 1974 note set out his duties   and a project time line through the summer 1977 launch   dates</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">6</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

To   provide some structure, Frewing established a   Mariner-Jupiter-Saturn 1977 On-Board Software Design Team   consisting of himself, Donald R.

They helped ensure the same close control of   software development as on Viking, with good documentation and   effective subroutine interfaces. The validation end of the   software development process was handled by the Capability   Demonstration Laboratory (CDL).

As Voyager developed   under the new conditions, cost savings became a key ingredient in   all engineering evaluations.

As pioneered on Mariner X, a disaster backup   sequence was stored in the Voyager 2 CCS memory for the Uranus   encounter, and later for the Neptune encounter.

NASA's Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology   funded a study of extended life attitude control systems as the   TOPS project wound down in 1972.

Using the same 4K, 18-bit-wide plated-wire memory   from the Viking Orbiter computer, HYPACE added   transistor-transistor logic (TTL) medium-scale integrated circuits   to create a relatively fast (28-microsecond cycle) processor with   index registers for addressing. Byte-serial architecture was   possible because the TTL chips were designed for 4-bit parallel   operation, so the 18-bit words could be moved around in five   cycles instead of the 18 a serial machine would need, increasing   overall speed. Index registering meant that the same block of code   could be used for all three axes, reducing memory requirements. It   appeared that the attitude control systems of future spacecraft   would almost certainly benefit from such a computer.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Voyager was the first to do so, due to new   requirements. One difference between Voyager and Mariner and   Viking is that the latter two were fairly rigid in construction.   Voyager's radioisotope thermoelectric generators, however, were   mounted on a boom to keep radiation leakage away from scientific   instruments. In addition, the magnetometer was boom mounted to   avoid interference from spacecraft magnetic fields caused by   motors, actuators, power buses, and electronics. Finally, the scan   platform was also on a boom to give a better field of view. The   extended booms made Voyager much less rigid in flight, with   thruster firings and maneuvers causing the booms to flex,   complicating the attitude control problem</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">23</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Additionally, the Titan III booster used for   Voyager required a "kick stage" to successfully inject Voyager   into the transfer orbit to Jupiter.

This was later raised to once about every 2   seconds, partly because of the command computer overload problem   mentioned above. To carry the heartbeat, six direct input lines,   similar to the 3-bit synchronization bus on the Shuttle, ran from   the HYPACE to the command computer. A "power code" was the content   of the 6 bits transmitted on those lines. For example, power code   37 was the simple heartbeat. Others related to passing information   such as pointing commands.

Every eight 240-millisecond cycles the heartbeat   was sent. Between times, the attitude control computer conducted   its self tests. If it failed, the heartbeat generator was   bypassed.

Richard J. Rice of JPL began by developing   software for a breadboard version of the data computer.

One hardware modification added direct memory access   circuits and provided for using them on each instruction cycle.   Direct memory access capability meant that some data could be sent   directly to the memory without having to go through the central   processor. In other computers, direct memory access is permitted   as a sort of interrupt and is often referred to as "cycle   stealing" because it takes time away from instruction execution.   In the data computer, it would have been foolhardy to do direct   memory access in that way because the data rate was so high that   the instructions might never get a chance to be executed quickly   enough for time-critical sequencing. Wooddell solved this by   adding a direct memory access cycle to those instructions that did   not already have cycles in which the memory was   accessed</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">48</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.

This type of circuit is very low powered, fast,   and can tolerate a wide range of voltages, making it excellent for   space use. Early in the 1970s, CMOS was still relatively new, so   it was with some risk that JPL chose the circuits. To go along   with the new CMOS processor, the data computer group fought for   CMOS memories as well. Trying to drive a slow plated-wire memory   with fast CMOS circuits would have negated the attempt to speed up   the computer. However, CMOS memories are volatile, in that if   power is cut off, the data stored in them disappear. The designers   of previous manned and unmanned spacecraft avoided volatile   memories, fearing that power transients would destroy the memories   at critical mission times. Voyager management had to be convinced   that the risk was acceptable.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">[</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">183</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;James T.   Kinsey, a JPL manager, was instrumental in getting the   semiconductor memory accepted because a method of providing backup   power was devised</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source6.html">52</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Voyager's primary electricity is alternating   current. The radioisotope generators produce direct current, which   is converted. By running a separate power line from the direct   current bus fed by the generators to the CMOS memories, the only   way power would be lost is if a major catastrophe destroyed the   generators. If that happened there would not be any need for a   data computer anyway.

Success with the CMOS memory led to the adoption   of all CMOS circuits in both computer systems on the Galileo   spacecraft. Along with the new chips, the memory changed with an   expansion to 8K.

Despite its   I/O rate, the arithmetic rate is quite slow, mostly due to   byte-serial operation. This meant 4-bit bytes are operated on in   sequence.
