There always seem to be   enough deficiencies in a final product that the designers wish   they had a second chance. In some ways the Apollo guidance   computer was a second chance for the MIT team since most worked on   the Polaris computer. That was MIT's most ambitious attempt at an   "embedded computer system," a computer that is intrinsic to a   larger component, such as a guidance system. Although the Apollo   computer started out to be quite similar to Polaris, it evolved   into something very different. The Apollo guidance computer had   two flight versions: Block I and Block II. Block I was basically   the same technology as the Polaris system. Block II incorporated   new technology within the original architecture.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Several factors led from the Block I   design to Block II. NASA's challenges to the MIT contract and the   decision to use the rendezvous method instead of a direct ascent   to the moon were decisive. A third factor related to reliability.   Finally, the benefits of the new technology influenced the   decision to make Block II.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Before NASA let the contract to MIT, but   after it was known that the Instrumentation Laboratory would be   accorded "sole source" status, several NASA individuals began   studying ways to consolidate flight computer development. In June   1961, Harry J. Goett of Goddard Space Flight Center recommended   that the computers needed for the Orbiting Astronomical   Observatory (OAO), Apollo, and the Saturn launch vehicle be the   same. He cited an IBM proposal for $5 [</FONT><B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">32</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;million to   do just that</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">17</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. On the same day Goett's recommendation, RCA   proposed the use of a 420-cubic-inch computer with only an 80-   watt power consumption and 24-bit word size as a general-purpose   spaceborne computer</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">18</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> . This proposal got nowhere and NASA's Robert G.   Chilton challenged Goett's idea, showing that the expected savings   would not materialize. Even though the projected cost of the   Apollo computer would decrease to $8 million from $10 million, the   OAO development costs would rise from $1.5 million to $5   million</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">19</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Ironically, in the same month, Ramon Alonso from   MIT met with Marshall Space Flight Center personnel about the use   of the Apollo computer in the Saturn</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">20</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Although MIT got the Apollo contract and IBM got   the contract for the Saturn computer, the idea of a duplicate   system did not die. Two years later, when the deficiencies of the   Polaris-based system were obvious and the solutions offered by the   new technology of the Block II version still unproved, David W.   Gilbert, NASA manager for Apollo guidance and control, proposed   replacing the MIT machine with the one IBM was building for   Saturn</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">21</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. It did not occur because Gilbert wanted NASA to   accept the reprogramming costs, and the existing configuration of   the IBM computer would not fit in the space allotted for it in the   CM. Nevertheless, MIT would still have to deal with NASA   misgivings about the hardware design as late as May 1964, when   Maj. Gen. Samuel C. Phillips, deputy director of the Apollo   Program, reported on a meeting to discuss the use of the triple   modular redundant Saturn launch vehicle computer in Apollo   </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">22</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The decision to have a separate CM and the   LEM influenced the transition to Block II by providing a   convenient dividing point in the Apollo program. The early Apollo   development flights were to use the CM only. Later flights would   include the LEM. Since Block I design and production had already   proceeded, planners decided to use the existing Block I in the   unmanned and early manned development flights (all relatively   simple earth-orbital missions) and to switch to Block II for the   more complex combined CM-LEM missions </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">23</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Reliability was another force behind Block   II. Daring early planning for the guidance system, redundancy was   considered a solution to the basic reliability problem. Designers   thought that two computers would be needed to provide the   necessary backup; however, they dropped this scheme for two   reasons. The ground had primary responsibility for determining the   slate vector (the position of the craft in threedimensional space)   in translunar, lunar orbit, and transearth   flight</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">24</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Moreover, none of the variations of the   two-computer or other redundancy schemes could meet the power,   weight, and size requirements</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">25</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. One way to provide some measure of protection is   to make the computer repairable in flight. The Block I design, due   to its modularity, could be fixed during a mission that carried   appropriate spares. At any rate, its predicted mean time between   failures (MTBF) [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">33</FONT></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;was 4,200 hours, about 20 times longer than   the longest projected mission </FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">26</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. But Block I's repair capability became a negative   factor when sealing the computer began to be considered more   important to reliability than the ability to repair   it</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">27</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Aside from packaging, overall malfunction   detection was improved in the Block II design, further increasing   reliability</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">28</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">The most important reason for going to   Block II was the availability of new technology. The Block I   design used core transistor logic. It had several   disadvantages:</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT></DL><UL>   <LI><FONT FACE="Geneva">It could not be complemented, a very   important basic operation in computer arithmetic that changes a   one to a zero or vice versa.</FONT>      <LI><FONT FACE="Geneva">It had the characteristic of "destructive   readout," in which a datum read from a flip-flop using core   transistor logic loses the datum; that forces the inclusion of a   circuit to rewrite the datum if it is to be retained after the   read cycle.</FONT>      <LI><FONT FACE="Geneva">Memory cycle time could not be fixed: in   Block I it was an average of 19.5 milliseconds, which was quite   slow for computers at the time, and the varying cycle caused   timing problems within the machine</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">29</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT></UL><DL>   <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">These disadvantages led MIT to begin   studying, as early as 1962, the possible use of integrated   circuits (ICs) to replace core transistor circuits. ICs, so   ubiquitous today, were only 3 years old then and thus had little   reliability history. It was therefore difficult to consider their   use in a manned spacecraft without convincing NASA that the   advantages far outweighed the risks.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">To accomplish this, the MIT team chose a   direct-coupled transistor logic (DCTL) NOR gate with a three-input   element,</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">30</A></FONT><FONT   FACE="Geneva"> </FONT></SUP></B><FONT FACE="Geneva">consisting of   three transistors and four resistors. NOR logic inverts the   results of applying a Boolean OR operation to the three inputs. It   took nearly 5,000 of these simple circuits to build an Apollo   computer. Using a variety of circuits would have simplified the   design since the component count would have been reduced, but by   using the NOR alone, overall simplicity and reliability   increased</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">31</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. Also, the time it took the machine to cycle became   fixed at 11.7 milliseconds, a double bonus in that speed increased   and cycle time was consistent</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">32</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">Aside from these advantages, MIT believed   that the lead time to the first flight would permit reliability to   be established and the cost of the ICs to come   down</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">33</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. At the time, the production of such circuits low,   and they were more expensive than building core transistor   circuits. To place the production rate in perspective, MIT chose   the NOR ICs in the fall of 1962 and by the summer of 1963, 60% of   the [</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Geneva">34</FONT></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">]&nbsp;total U.S. output of microcircuits was being   used in Apollo prototype construction</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">34</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">. This is one of the few cases in which NASA's   requirements acted as a direct spur to the computer industry. When   MIT switched to ICs, it kept the Apollo computer as "state of the   art" at least during its design stage. It would be hopelessly   outdated technologically by the time of the lunar landing 7 years   later, but in 1962, using the new microcircuits seemed to be a   risk. This view is contested by one member of the MIT team, who   later said that the decision "wasn't bold; it was just the easy   thing to do to get the size and power and other   requirements"</FONT><B><SUP><FONT   FACE="Geneva"><A HREF="Source2.html">35</A></FONT></SUP></B><FONT   FACE="Geneva">.</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">&nbsp;</FONT>      <DT><FONT FACE="Geneva">With the ICs fully incorporated in the   Apollo computer and the transition from Block I to Block II   complete, NASA possessed a machine that was more up to date   technologically.
