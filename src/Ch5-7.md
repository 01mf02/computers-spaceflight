### On to the outer planets

\[**170**\] Experience and the appreciation of the flexibility of
computer processors are the legacy of the computer systems development
for the inner planet probes. Consistent and detailed documentation,
simple, reliable, and reusable hardware designs, and the practice of
many missions contributed to the later and continuing success of
Voyager. Just as management experience gained during Apollo applied to
the shuttle, JPL's success with Viking made the concurrent development
of Voyager and Galileo easier. People like Samuel Deese, who gained
practical experience in the 1960s, led subsystem management in the
1970s. Viking's Wayne Kohl went on to Galileo after the Mars landings in
a position similar to the one he held on the former project. Both
Voyager and Galileo are better projects because of the continuity of
techniques and personnel.
