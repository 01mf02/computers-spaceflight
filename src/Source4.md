90. There are widely disparate estimates of how many people actually
    contributed to the shuttle software. Macina of IBM says 275, but l think
    he means coders. John Aaron of NASA, head of Spacecraft Software in
    1983, estimates 900 contractors and 90 civil servants. Parten said 2,000
    but that may include everyone in all contracting organizations working
    on hardware and software. The figure of 1,000 seems reasonable for
    software developers, as it is consistent with similar projects.
